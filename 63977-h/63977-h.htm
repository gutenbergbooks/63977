<p class="no-indent bold center xxlarge">New Magnet Library</p>

<p class="no-indent bold center p1">PRICE, FIFTEEN CENTS</p>

<p class="no-indent bold center p1"><em>Not a Dull Book in This List</em></p>


<p class="p2">Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The
fact that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely
due to the work of a specialist. The man who wrote
these stories produced no other type of fiction. His mind was
concentrated upon the creation of new plots and situations in
which his hero emerged triumphantly from all sorts of trouble,
and landed the criminal just where he should be—behind the
bars.</p>

<p>The author of these stories knew more about writing detective
stories than any other single person.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have
been selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend
each of them as being fully as interesting as any detective
story between cloth covers which sells at ten times the price.</p>

<p>If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the
New Magnet Library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise
and delight you.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.
<br />
<small>STARTLING NEWS.</small></h2>


<p>Nicholas Carter, and his first assistant, Chickering
Carter, had risen early that morning, but not for the
usual reason. It was a very unusual occasion in the
great detective’s household, for he and Chick were
actually going away for two weeks’ vacation in the
Adirondacks.</p>

<p>The train that was to carry the two to the Great
North Woods was scheduled to leave shortly after
eight o’clock, and many preparations had been deferred
until that morning. Now, however, everything
was practically ready, their trunk was packed, locked,
and strapped, their suit cases were nearly filled, and
they had time for a bite of breakfast and a glance
at the morning papers, which had thus far been neglected.</p>

<p>Nick seemed to be the only one who was interested
in the news. In fact, his assistant made a wry face
when he saw his chief reaching for one of the papers.</p>

<p>“Can’t you forget that sort of thing?” he asked, in
an injured tone. “I was hoping you would until we
got well started, at least.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” Nick asked, in a bewildered
tone. “Oh, I see what you are driving at! You are
afraid I’ll see something interesting in the line of
crimes and mysteries, and decide at the last minute to
stay at home? Is that the idea?”</p>

<p>His assistant nodded gloomily. “Correct,” he answered.
“I never know which way you are going to
jump, or at what moment. When I’m trying to get
you off for a holiday, especially, I feel the greatest
responsibility. You have such a way of changing your
mind, and, if you don’t, somebody usually bobs up
with a case that you find irresistible. You’ve been
working your head off for months, and you are run
down; you know you are.” Chick grinned. “You
are not exactly at the breaking point yet,” he went
on, “but you are just a little stale, and that won’t
do, you know. Any day something may break that
will require your keenest brain work, and your last
ounce of strength and agility. Of course, things will
turn up; of course, you’ll have all sorts of calls every
day, and if you allow yourself to read the papers,
you’ll run across plenty of things that will prove fascinating
to you. Can’t you cut yourself loose, though—absolutely?”</p>

<p>“I’ve done harder things than that, grandmother,”
Nick answered, “but I really don’t see the necessity
for that sort of total abstinence. If you think I’m
going to cut out all newspapers for two weeks, you’re
very much mistaken. I’ve promised to go, though,
and I’m going—unless, of course, something turns up
that is altogether too big to neglect.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>He opened the paper, whereupon Chick gave an exaggerated
sigh of resignation.</p>

<p>“What is to be is to be, I suppose,” the younger
detective murmured; “or, in more up-to-date form, she
goes as she lays.”</p>

<p>It may be inferred, therefore, that he was far from
surprised, when his chief gave a startled exclamation
a few moments later.</p>

<p>“Well,” Chick asked pessimistically, “what have you
struck now? We are not going away, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Of course we are, you idiot!” Nick answered excitedly.
“You’ll agree with me, though, I’m sure, that
it would have been a calamity if we had missed
this. It looks as if we had had our last tussle with
‘Green-eye’ Gordon.”</p>

<p>Chick’s eyes widened. “What do you mean?” he
asked. “Has Gordon died in prison?”</p>

<p>Nick nodded soberly. “He was burned to death
last night in a fire that destroyed one wing of Clinton
Prison,” he replied, his eye hastily running over
the rest of the article.</p>

<p>Presently the paper was passed to Chick. This, in
part, was what the latter read.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.
<br />
<small>“GREEN-EYE” GORDON.</small></h2>


<p>“Shortly after ten o’clock last night fire was discovered
in the laundry at Clinton Prison. The blaze
spread with surprising rapidity, and as the laundry
was in the basement of one of the main wings of
three tiers of cells above it, the lives of many of
the convicts were soon seen to be in danger.</p>

<p>“Under the circumstances, it is surprising that more
lives were not lost, but the best information obtainable
at the present time is that three of the inmates
were fatally burned—including the clever and infamous
Green-eye Gordon—that many were injured or temporarily
overcome, and that one took advantage of
the excitement to escape.</p>

<p>“As soon as it was seen that the fire was beyond
control, so far as the prison’s fire-fighting facilities
were concerned, and that there was danger of asphyxiation
from the dense smoke, the cells of each tier in
the threatened wing were unlocked simultaneously,
and there was a general exodus of frightened prisoners.
The scene defies description, for the delay in
opening the cells had given the trapped men an opportunity
to work themselves up into a frenzy, and,
as a result, the guards were powerless to handle them.</p>

<p>“A general jail delivery might have followed if the
convicts had realized their power, but fear had driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
everything else out of their minds for the time being,
and in consequence, only one man, Convict No. 9,371,
made his escape. He is known to the world beyond
the gray walls as “Shang” Libby, a yegg, who had
made his headquarters at Buffalo. Libby must have
followed one of the guards when the latter left the
inclosure for help, and having waited until the door of
freedom had been opened, he quietly struck the guard
down and passed through. He was one of those who
had hastily dressed himself in the prison uniform
and unless he can manage to get other clothing there
is no doubt that he will soon be rounded up.”</p>

<p>Then followed a long account of the fire, and references
to those who had been killed or seriously injured.
The article ended with the following:</p>

<p>“The death of Ernest Gordon, widely known as
Green-eye Gordon, was the most ignominious one,
and hardly in keeping with this notorious criminal’s
career. There was nothing spectacular about it. Gordon
might have been expected to play a conspicuous
part at such a time—to rally the prisoners for a concerted
attempt at escape, for instance—but he does
not seem to have distinguished himself in any such
way. Indeed, it would appear that his daring and
initiative left him at the last, for there seems no very
good reason for his death, when most of his fellow
prisoners escaped.</p>

<p>“Of course, some accident must have happened to
him, for he was found trodden to death by the others
in their bestial rush. His face disfigured beyond recognition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gordon hailed from New York, and those who
know have long classed him as one of the cleverest
and most dangerous criminals this country has ever
produced. He came of a good family, and was well
educated, but early showed a tendency to criminal
pursuits. Apparently he reformed, however, and for
several years was employed by one of the great detective
agencies.</p>

<p>“In this capacity he showed himself to be very able
and daring, so much so that he advanced rapidly,
and long enjoyed the utmost confidence of his employers.
In the end, however, it was learned that he
had been using his position for his own ends, and had
really never given up his career of crime. He must
have known that a storm was brewing, for, as usual,
he managed to get away a few jumps ahead.</p>

<p>“After that, thanks to the invaluable experience
he had gained as a detective, he turned his attention
to much more ambitious and lucrative pursuits, soon
becoming one of the most troublesome thorns in the
side of the police of this city and elsewhere. Gordon
always was versatile, and handled many kinds of
crime with remarkable success. Toward the last, however,
he developed something approaching a specialty
in the shape of blackmail on a large scale. He seemed
to have an uncanny facility for learning the secrets
of the wealthy and prominent, and using them for
purposes of blackmail.</p>

<p>“Crimes of this sort are not easy to establish in
a legal way, or to punish, for the victims seldom
raise an outcry. Nevertheless, that lifelong foe of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
crime and criminals, Nicholas Carter, took up the trail,
and finally brought Gordon to bay. The capture and
trial of two years ago are doubtless fresh in the
minds of many newspaper readers.</p>

<p>“Gordon acquired his nickname of Green Eye from
the fact that he had a pair of peculiar, rather nondescript
gray eyes, which were said to emit a green
light when the man was angry or excited. In addition,
his eyes showed an inclination to cross at such
times, although perfectly normal at all others. In
fact, it is claimed that these distinguishing characteristics
more than once served to identify the clever
rogue, whose remarkable histrionic ability and skill
at make-up would otherwise have enabled him to defy
detection.”</p>

<p>Of course, neither of the detectives read all of
this. They did not need to, for they knew a great
deal more about Ernest Gordon than any one else
could have told them.</p>

<p>Chick followed his chief’s example in glancing
through the article and getting the main points that
were new to him. Then he looked up with an odd
expression.</p>

<p>“Well, it certainly sounds final enough,” he remarked.
“I find it hard to believe, though, that Green
Eye is dead, and that he died in such a way.”</p>

<p>“It is somewhat difficult to credit it,” Nick agreed.
“That’s the way things frequently happen, though.
Fate isn’t always dramatic in its methods according
to our theatrical standards. No, it seems safe enough
to believe that Ernest Gordon won’t give us any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
trouble, and I find a certain amount of relief in the
thought. I’m willing to confess now that there were
times when I doubted my ability to bring him to
account. In other words, I felt myself nearer defeat
at his hands than I had ever done in any other case.”</p>

<p>The detective pulled out his watch, glanced at it,
and threw his napkin aside. “We must hustle if we
are going to catch that train,” he announced.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he and Chick were whirled
away to the station. Their well-earned vacation
had begun, but they were far from carefree.</p>

<p>The thought of Ernest Gordon persisted in haunting
their minds, and somehow it seemed to dull the edge
of their anticipations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.
<br />
<small>NOT SO DEAD, AFTER ALL.</small></h2>


<p>Two days later a striking-looking, conspicuously
well-groomed man presented himself at Nick Carter’s
door.</p>

<p>He did not give his name, which is not to be wondered
at under the circumstances, for the caller was
Green-eye Gordon—not his ghost, but the man himself,
substantial flesh and blood, escaped convict, and
first-class criminal.</p>

<p>For once Chick’s intuitions had been keener than his
chief’s. The younger detective had been inclined
to question the validity of Gordon’s death in the absence
of any more conclusive testimony than that given
in the first accounts of the fire. Nick, however, had
been in a mood to discourage such skepticism—perhaps
because of that relief to which he had confessed.</p>

<p>The fact was that it was Green Eye who had
escaped, and not the yegg from Buffalo. Gordon
had stumbled over the latter’s body during that mad
rush for safety. The yegg was by no means dead at
the time, but had been overcome by the smoke, and,
without a moment’s hesitation, Gordon had determined
to profit by the encounter.</p>

<p>He had no definite plan, but it was characteristic
of him that whereas the others were interested only in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
escaping the flames, he was looking for the opportunity
to escape from the prison itself, and was prepared
to profit by every promising circumstance.</p>

<p>It occurred to him at once that an exchange of
coats would be to his advantage, and he proceeded
at once to make the exchange, stripping off the unconscious
man’s coat, and putting his own halfway on
in place of it.</p>

<p>The reason for this may be easily guessed. The
gray coats—for stripes are no longer in vogue in
New York State—bore each man’s prison number,
and, therefore, by such a simple exchange, identities
could be shifted temporarily.</p>

<p>Gordon’s number was 39,470, and, of course, it
was known to all the keepers and prisoners as standing
for the identity of the formidable Green Eye. The
other man’s number, on the other hand, had no particular
significance, for the yegg was an ordinary
criminal, of comparatively little intelligence, who had
not made himself conspicuous in any way, either in
or out of the prison.</p>

<p>Consequently, if there should prove to be later on
any reason to believe that Libby was missing, his absence
would not be likely to cause any great commotion,
for it would be taken for granted that his capture
was only a question of time.</p>

<p>Gordon had reasoned shrewdly, as usual, and had
thus, by his own promptness and resourcefulness, put
himself in the way of the luck that subsequently
favored him.</p>

<p>He had feigned an injury, and had thrown himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
down in the prison courtyard, after taking care to
stagger close to the main gates, and a shadow of the
projecting section of the wall. There he was ignored,
for the flames in the burning wing were mounting
higher and higher, and all the men were not yet out
of it.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before Green Eye’s chance
had come, but it did come, as he had felt sure it would.
One of the guards rushed past him and approached
a small door at one side of the big, double gates. Evidently
the man had been sent on some important errand,
which would take him outside the prison walls.</p>

<p>The keeper looked behind him with a wary eye
to make sure that he was not followed. He had
fears of a general break for liberty, but apparently
no one was paying any attention to him.</p>

<p>Therefore he excitedly inserted a key in the lock,
and, after some fumbling, opened the door. It was
then that Gordon had pounced upon him.</p>

<p>One blow had been enough. It caught the unfortunate
guard behind the ear and sent him hurtling
through the opening. In a moment the convict had
followed.</p>

<p>Gordon dashed across the road before the vanguard
of the crowd from the town had reached the
spot, and, dodging through the extensive lumber yard,
made his way to the outskirts of Dannemora, his goal
being a certain tumble-down, abandoned house.</p>

<p>There he found what he sought—a moisture-proof
box of considerable size, containing a complete outfit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of clothing, an automatic of the latest model, and no
less than five hundred dollars in gold.</p>

<p>We have hinted that Ernest Gordon was no ordinary
criminal, and the truth of that has doubtless
begun to shine through this narrative. Here, at any
rate, is striking evidence of it.</p>

<p>Green Eye had always preferred to work alone, as
many of the most successful criminals have done. He
had friends, however, and one of these had carried
out his directions. The gates of Clinton Prison had
not even closed behind Gordon, when the latter had
begun to plan for a possible escape, and the planting
of this box played an important part in the arrangement.</p>

<p>During his many months in the prison, Green Eye
had not succeeded in liberating himself, but now that
the fire had enabled him to escape, the box was waiting
for him, thanks to his unusual foresight.</p>

<p>Thus it was that he had completely eluded pursuit.
The authorities were looking for a commonplace, unimaginative
yegg, who went by the name of Shang
Libby, and who might be expected to retain some, at
least, of his prison garments. It is little wonder,
therefore, that they failed to capture the polished and
superdaring Gordon, who lost no time in starting for
New York City in a sleeping car.</p>

<p>The fugitive’s first thought when he reached the
metropolis was one of revenge. He had no idea of
killing Nick Carter for the part the latter had played
in his downfall, for murder had never been in his
line. There are many other kinds of revenge, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and Gordon was determined to avail himself of
one or more of them.</p>

<p>He wished to humiliate Nick to the utmost, if possible,
and, incidentally, to do so in such a way that
his success would line his pockets with gold.</p>

<p>He had a plan, when he presented himself at Nick’s
door, but it was lacking in many details, for these he
had decided to leave to the inspiration of the moment.
In any case, however, he meant to palm himself off
as a would-be client, and, having thus gained the
detective’s confidence, to proceed with the rest of the
scheme, or some modification of it.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Carter in?” he asked anxiously, when the
butler opened the door.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” the servant replied, noting with approval
the visitor’s apparent prosperity and air of importance.
“Mr. Carter is out of town at present.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible? For how long?”</p>

<p>“He went away day before yesterday, and expected
to be absent for two weeks.”</p>

<p>“How unfortunate! I have a case of the utmost
importance—the sort of thing no one else can handle,”
the caller said, with the semblance of profound disappointment.
“One of his assistants might help me to
some extent, however, or bring the matter to Mr. Carter’s
attention by telegraph.”</p>

<p>Again the butler shook his head regretfully. He
was being very indiscreet, but he did not suspect it
for a moment, owing to the impression the stranger
made upon him.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that’s out of the question, too, sir,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
he answered. “There is no one at home who could
attend to you. It’s the first time it has happened in
years.”</p>

<p>The stranger seemed greatly distressed.</p>

<p>“This is terrible!” he cried. “I don’t know what
I shall do if I can’t get hold of Mr. Carter. I would
be very sorry to break up his vacation, but I’m sure
if he knew the circumstances, he would not hesitate
for a moment. Some very prominent people are involved,
and, unless something is done speedily, there
will be nothing short of a national scandal. Surely,
you will give me Mr. Carter’s address, will you not?”</p>

<p>The butler hesitated—and fell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.
<br />
<small>THE DETECTIVE’S “HALFWAY HOUSE.”</small></h2>


<p>Chick had been in favor of cutting off all communication
with the detective’s residence in New York.
It was not because he himself felt any great need of a
holiday, but rather because he had an exaggerated
notion that his chief was badly in need of a change.</p>

<p>Nick, however, had vetoed this suggestion, and left
things largely to his butler’s discretion. The butler
had been in his service for years, and had shown himself
by no means a fool.</p>

<p>“If anything big develops,” Nick had told him, “do
not hesitate to telegraph for me, or have me called
on the long distance—if there isn’t time to write. I
don’t want to miss an important case.”</p>

<p>The butler remembered these words now—and forgot
that he did not even know the caller’s name. Carried
away by the man’s air of authority, he blurted
out the desired information.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter is staying at the Buck’s Head Inn,
Little Saranac Lake, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Many thanks! That’s all I need. I’m sure Mr.
Carter will respond at once when he hears what’s in
the wind,” Gordon declared importantly, and having
made a note of the address, thanked the butler again,
and returned to the waiting taxi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Green Eye had seen a great light as a result of the
butler’s incautious revelations, and all his previous
plans had been discarded. In their place a new one
was growing—a plan that promised to set a record for
daring, and to bring the detective nearer to professional
shipwreck than he had been in all of his career.</p>

<p>The new plan did not involve an interview with
Nick. On the contrary, it was built upon the fact
that the detective was hundreds of miles away, buried
in the woods.</p>

<p>Therefore, as may be guessed, Green Eye did not
make use of the address the butler had given him. He
was quite satisfied to have created the impression that
he intended to communicate with Nick at once, and
that the latter might return in the course of a day
or two.</p>

<p>The following morning an individual climbed the
stairs leading to one of Nick’s “halfway houses,” that
particular one being on One Hundred and Twenty-fifth
Street.</p>

<p>Nick Carter maintained a number of these places
in different parts of the city, and in each of them
he kept several complete changes of clothing and a
supply of wigs, false mustaches, beards, make-up articles,
and the like.</p>

<p>Their mission is perfectly obvious. Under ordinary
circumstances, it was safe enough for the detective
and his assistants to disguise themselves at home,
and to return to their headquarters at their pleasure.
When they were handling an unusually delicate case,
however, or dealing with exceptionally clever lawbreakers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
they found it necessary to take further precautions,
and these so-called halfway houses then came
in handy.</p>

<p>In other words, the secret bases of supplies—each
of which had two exits—made it possible for them to
leave and return to their headquarters openly, and
without disguise, although the intervening hours might
be devoted to the most relentless shadowing, carried
on under all sorts of guises.</p>

<p>The man who climbed the stairs at the One Hundred
and Twenty-fifth Street place, therefore, might
easily have been Nick in the act of returning from
some such expedition. He did not look in the least
like the great detective, but that proved nothing, and
his actions went far to indicate that he was Nick or
one of the latter’s assistants.</p>

<p>He boldly approached the door of the room, the
location of which did not seem to give him the slightest
trouble, despite the fact that there was nothing on the
door to guide him. He seemed to have some little
difficulty in getting the door open, to be sure; but,
after working at the lock for two or three minutes,
he gained entrance.</p>

<p>Many criminals would have given a great deal to
know the location of one of those rooms, but Nick
did not dream that one rascal had long since discovered
the halfway house in Harlem.</p>

<p>The man who had gained entrance by picking the
lock was Green-eye Gordon, of course.</p>

<p>He had learned of the place shortly before Nick
had caught him, two years or more back, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
been more or less uncertain as to the present use of
the room. The detective might have given it up in the
interval, for all he knew, but he had resolved to put
his knowledge to the test, and now he was rewarded,
for a glance about the place showed him that it was
still employed by the detective.</p>

<p>Rows of clothing hung in orderly array on hooks
along the walls. At one side there was a long mirror,
which enabled one to view oneself from head to feet,
and between the windows, at the rear, was a dressing
table, which looked as if it might belong to some musical-comedy
star, so cluttered was it with make-up
materials of all sorts.</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour later when Ernest Gordon
let himself out, locked the door behind him—after
some further effort—and sauntered downstairs.</p>

<p>Another complete transformation had taken place
in his appearance. He was no longer the hunted criminal
who had escaped from Clinton Prison, no longer
the dressy individual who had presented himself at
the detective’s, the day before, and least of all did he
look like the man who had ascended those stairs some
fifty minutes previously.</p>

<p>Now, to all intents and purposes, he was Nick
Carter himself.</p>

<p>Not only was he wearing one of the excellent suits
the detective kept for his more respectable disguises,
but in build, walk, features, and even expression, he
was as much like Nick Carter as one pea is like another.</p>

<p>His astounding plan had ripened into action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.
<br />
<small>IN NICK’S SHOES.</small></h2>


<p>The butler happened to be out ordering supplies
when the detective’s front bell rang, and, as Mrs.
Peters, the housekeeper, was near the door, she answered
it.</p>

<p>On the tip of her tongue she had the answer which
she had already given to several inquiries—that the
detective was out of town. Therefore, her amazement
may be imagined when she found—as she supposed—that
it was Nick himself who was outside.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, sir!” she ejaculated, starting
in surprise. “What in the world are you doing back
so soon?”</p>

<p>The masquerader smiled one of Nick’s characteristically
genial smiles.</p>

<p>“I was called back, I’m sorry to say,” he answered,
his voice taking on the detective’s familiar tones. “Joseph
furnished my address yesterday, I believe, and
the man he gave it to wired me to come back. The
case was so important that I felt I had to. I hope
to return, though, in a few days, and, as I have everything
here, of course, I didn’t bring any baggage.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” exclaimed the housekeeper. “I
feared it would be just like this, but I hoped you would
stay this time. Didn’t Mr. Chickering come back with
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I left him at Little Saranac, but shall send for
him if I need him.”</p>

<p>As they had been speaking, the housekeeper had
instinctively stepped aside, and Gordon had passed
her. Now he started up the stairs, in the direction
of the study.</p>

<p>“You’ll have some lunch ready at the usual time?”
he asked, looking back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Of course, sir,” was the reply; and that was all
that was said.</p>

<p>If the new arrival had been Nick himself, he would
have smilingly apologized to Mrs. Peters for having
broken in so unexpectedly upon her well-earned relaxation,
but Green Eye was altogether too selfish to think
of such things.</p>

<p>Thus far he had played his part very well, but there
were many pitfalls in his path, and there was no
knowing at what moment he might fall into one of
them. His eyes were not Nick’s eyes, and his disposition
was not Nick’s disposition—far from it, in fact.</p>

<p>At any moment his innate harshness and tyranny
might assert themselves.</p>

<p>Moreover, his habits were unlike those of the detective.
He smoked much more, for one thing, and he
drank. Nick, to be sure, had consumed many a glass
of beer and wine—for effect and under protest—but
he had no real liking for anything of the sort, and
no one had had a better opportunity than he to note
the evil effects of drink.</p>

<p>Naturally, Gordon had resolved to deny himself
whenever he was under the eye of those who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
familiar with Nick’s habits, but it remained to be seen
whether he would succeed in keeping to that resolution.</p>

<p>Already he had forgotten one little thing which
might have caused him embarrassment, and might still
do so, for that matter. He had meant to offer some
plausible explanation of his failure to let himself in
with a latchkey, but he had forgotten all about it at the
time, and now it might seem strange if he brought up
the subject.</p>

<p>He had not come straight to the house from the
changing room on One Hundred and Twenty-fifth
Street, but had shown himself in one or two places
where Nick was well known, his idea being to see if
his disguise would pass inspection elsewhere before
submitting himself to the scrutiny of Nick’s household.
That had consumed some time; consequently, the
luncheon hour was near when he arrived at the house.</p>

<p>He was on fire with eagerness to rummage in Nick’s
desk, hunt about in his file cases, and rifle his safe,
but he knew that he could not accomplish much before
lunch, and he did not wish to make himself conspicuous
by passing over that meal. Perhaps he could
accomplish something, however.</p>

<p>With that idea in view, he approached one of the
detective’s metal file cases. The drawers were locked,
but he found a means of opening them, and the drawer
he first pulled out was that devoted to the letter “G.”</p>

<p>A few moments spent in thumbing over the big
cards filed there brought the desired one to light. It
was that devoted to himself, and bore, in addition to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
lot of closely written information, a photograph and
a set of facsimile finger prints.</p>

<p>Gordon seemed to take a grim delight in reading
the accurate description of himself, and the careful
details concerning his career, characteristic methods,
and so on.</p>

<p>“Not bad!” he muttered presently. “In fact, it’s a
little too true for comfort. I think I shall have to
withdraw it.”</p>

<p>And going over to the wastebasket, he deliberately
tore the card into small bits and dropped them into the
receptacle.</p>

<p>After that he returned to the file case, fingered
over some of the other cards, and then leaned thoughtfully
on the opened drawer.</p>

<p>“There are hundreds and thousands of cases recorded
here,” he mused, “but apparently they are not
the most important ones, and it’s safe to say that
Carter isn’t keeping records of his most confidential
affairs in such an easily accessible place. I have no
doubt I could milk lots of these fellows for tidy little
sums, but I’m after big game just now—not rabbits.”</p>

<p>His gaze strayed in the direction of the detective’s
safe, and a more calculating look came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised if you hold the records
I’m looking for—or some of them,” he muttered aloud,
addressing the big safe. “If not, you may contain
something else of interest. At any rate, I’m going to
find out, the first chance I get.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.
<br />
<small>AN INTERRUPTION.</small></h2>


<p>The audacity of Green-eye Gordon’s venture has
doubtless been apparent from the beginning, but now
the real purpose of his impersonation has begun to
be discernible.</p>

<p>He was not there in Nick Carter’s shoes, in undisturbed
possession of the detective’s study, for the
mere satisfaction involved in such a daring masquerade.
Of course, the experience was a stimulating
one, and the clever rascal chuckled to himself every
time he pictured Nick’s face when the detective learned
the truth. It was something more practical, though,
that had brought him there.</p>

<p>Naturally, if he succeeded in gaining access to the
safe, he would not be above appropriating to his own
uses whatever money and valuables he might find
there, but his desires even went beyond that—far
beyond it.</p>

<p>He knew that Nick had handled many of the most
delicate cases that had ever developed in this country,
and was the custodian of more secrets than had
come into the possession of any other American.</p>

<p>Among those secrets he had no doubt were many
of such a nature that those concerned would feel compelled
to part with large sums of money, in order that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
their secrets might be kept. Some of them doubtless
were men and women now wealthy or distinguished,
who had some secret connected with their past lives
which they would go to almost any lengths to keep
the world from knowing. In other cases, the guilty
might be dead, or unable to pay, but the records would
probably give the names of relatives, friends, or
former business associates who might be successfully
blackmailed.</p>

<p>That was it—blackmail on a huge and hitherto
unprecedented scale.</p>

<p>The accomplished scoundrel had made up his mind
that Nick Carter’s records would prove nothing less
than a gold mine, and he meant to work that mine
for all it was worth in the next week or ten days. Nick
might have destroyed the most confidential and dangerous
of these records, but Gordon did not believe
that to be the case.</p>

<p>“They are too valuable to him in his work,” he told
himself. “And, even if they were not, the keeping of
records gets to be a habit. Of course, he may realize
that some of them would be more dangerous than a
few tons of dynamite, if they should fall into the
wrong hands, and he may have placed the ones of
that description in some safe-deposit vault. If he
has, that will mean much more trouble, but if I can
locate the vault, I ought to be able to trick those in
charge of it into giving me access to the box, even
if I can’t produce the key. Am I not Carter himself,
and are not keys lost or mislaid in the best-regulated
families?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s hope that won’t be necessary, though. I
trust I shall find what I want right in this room.”</p>

<p>He was summoned to luncheon then, but he came
through the ordeal that followed with flying colors.
Joseph, the detective’s butler, served him in person,
and evidently found nothing more suspicious than Mrs.
Peters had done. Gordon still had himself well in
hand, and, after the brief greetings were over, little
was said.</p>

<p>“I’ll eat what’s set before me,” Green Eye had decided.
“The servants are well trained, and ought to
know Carter’s likes and dislikes by this time; therefore
I can’t go far wrong in eating what they serve, whether
I like it or not. It won’t be easy to deny myself, and
to keep on the alert, but I shall have to pay some penalties,
I suppose, for aspiring to be the great and exalted
Nick Carter.” And he grinned at the thought.</p>

<p>After luncheon the impostor hurried back upstairs,
and hunted up a box of Nick’s favorite Havana cigars.
A handful of them underwent a careful selection, and
a more or less appreciative sniffing before being transferred
to his pocket.</p>

<p>“Not so bad,” he commented mentally. “A little
too dry, though, and I’ve smoked better.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he did not seem averse to smoking
these, one after another.</p>

<p>“I shall have to go out before long, I suppose,”
he decided. “It’s understood that I’ve been called
back on important business, and, as it isn’t convenient
for my new client to call on me here, I’ll be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to meet him elsewhere, and to make a noise like action.”</p>

<p>That did not deter him, however, from making an
immediate descent upon the safe, but he soon found
that he would be obliged to defer serious activities in
that connection. He had hoped to be able to open
the safe by merely putting one ear to the door and
listening to the fall of the tumblers in the lock, but
five or ten minutes’ effort convinced him that that
was out of the question.</p>

<p>“It can’t be done with a lock like this,” he concluded,
with a muttered imprecation. “It looks to me
as if I would have to force my way in if I’m going
to get in at all. That will be decidedly risky, at best,
but I think I can do it quietly enough, and, after it’s
over, I ought to be able to find some means of concealing
my handiwork. Not just now, though, thanks.
I’ll take something a little easier, first.”</p>

<p>And with that he turned his attention to the desk.</p>

<p>The top had been cleared of its accumulation of
papers before the detective’s departure, and the drawers
were all locked, but Green Eye was provided with
certain handy little tools. To be sure, it took two or
three minutes to open each drawer, but soon the contents
of three or four of them lay at his disposal
in plain sight, and he determined to examine these
papers and books before opening the other drawers.</p>

<p>He was engaged in this absorbing occupation, when
the lower bell rang and roused him with a start.</p>

<p>“Wonder who that is?” he asked himself apprehensively,
then shrugged his shoulders. “This won’t do!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
he muttered. “If I’m going to be as nervous as a cat
at every sound, I had better give up. What difference
does it make who it is; I’m master of the situation.”</p>

<p>He listened attentively, and heard Joseph go to
the door, after which there was a murmur of voices,
followed by steps on the stairs. Presently, the butler
knocked and entered.</p>

<p>“I thought I told you at luncheon that I was still
out of town,” Gordon said angrily. “I came back for
this one case, nothing else, and I don’t want to be
bothered by every Tom, Dick, and Harry.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t forget, sir, I assure you,” Joseph said
apologetically. “It’s Mr. Cray, though, and I felt
you would want to make an exception in his case.
There’s a gentleman with him.”</p>

<p>Gordon knew what that meant, for he had studied
Nick Carter almost as thoroughly as the detective
had studied him. Moreover, had he not himself figured
not inconspicuously in detective circles not many
years before? Consequently, he knew that the Cray
referred to was Jack Cray, a former police detective,
who for years had been in business for himself, and
who, curiously enough, was a close friend of Nick’s.</p>

<p>The two were about as unlike as possible, but Cray,
big, methodical, tireless, and brave to the point of
recklessness, was a fine example of his type, and had
won Nick’s friendship and assistance, giving, in return,
a rare gratitude and loyalty.</p>

<p>Nick had thrown many cases in Cray’s way, and,
on the other hand, had found his big, lumbering friend
of considerable assistance now and then. In fact, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
worked together unusually well, for Cray had all the
plodding methods of the police department at his command,
to supplement Carter’s swift intuitions, and
the ex-police detective—unlike many of his kind—was
always ready to follow Nick’s leadership, and defer
to the latter’s better judgment.</p>

<p>Should the bogus Nick Carter see Cray, though?
He did not in the least fear discovery at Cray’s hands,
but the interview might lead to something embarrassing.
On the other hand, it might be most fortunate.</p>

<p>Obviously, Cray had brought one of his clients to
Nick, and that meant that the big fellow felt himself
more or less out of his depth, and wished to consult
with his brilliant friend.</p>

<p>If the case were important enough, it would be
worth while for Green Eye to look into it. He felt
himself quite capable of solving almost any puzzle if
he chose to solve it, but, aside from that, there was
a possibility of pickings—of blackmail again. But
much depended upon the client.</p>

<p>“Who is the other man?” the criminal asked eagerly.
“Did Cray say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It’s Mr. Griswold—Mr. Lane A. Griswold.”</p>

<p>The man behind the desk whistled softly, and a
gleam came into his eyes.</p>

<small>THE RASCAL’S FIRST CLIENT.</small></h2>


<p>Green Eye’s decision had been an immediate one
when he heard the second man’s name, for Lane A.
Griswold was several times a millionaire, and the
owner of the New York <em>Chronicle and Observer</em>, one
of the biggest and most influential of the country
morning papers—the first and most conspicuous link in
the chain of daily publications which now stretched all
the way across the continent.</p>

<p>Millionaires were worth cultivating, according to
Gordon’s philosophy, and he reasoned that if he could
get any sort of a hold upon this one, it might mean
the greatest stroke of luck in his life.</p>

<p>It was well to be on the safe side, however, and
he knew that Cray sometimes exhibited an unexpected
degree of intelligence. In the light of that thought, he
took an automatic from one of the open drawers, examined
it to make sure that it was loaded and in first-class
condition, and then dropped it into the right-hand
pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>After that he closed the drawers, darkened the room,
took up his cigar, and leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>“Nick Carter” was ready for another case—as ready
as a spider is for a fly.</p>

<p>The face of the man was calm, his expression indifferent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
but it is probable that his heart was beating
at an unusually rapid rate, and that more or less fear
was lurking behind that noncommittal exterior.</p>

<p>It would have been strange, indeed, had it not been
the case, for, with all his daring, this was no commonplace,
everyday affair for Ernest Gordon. He might
remind himself as much as he pleased that he was
“officially” dead, burned in the fire at Clinton Prison,
and that no one would be looking for him for that
reason, but the many months he had spent within those
grim walls had told upon him physically and mentally.</p>

<p>In other words, he was not yet his old self. The
unnatural conditions of prison life so lately left behind
had incapacitated him to a certain extent for this
abrupt plunge into the life outside, especially a plunge
of such an interesting character, yet he gave no sign
of all this, and, unless something unforeseen developed,
he would doubtless gain confidence and ability as
time went on.</p>

<p>For that matter, he had already planned and begun
to carry out a scheme which would have daunted any
other criminal in the country.</p>

<p>The supposed detective regarded his visitors with
lowered eyes as he rose languidly from his chair.</p>

<p>Jack Cray’s red face was redder than usual with
excitement, and there was something about his manner
that suggested he had brought the famous newspaper
owner there for no trivial reason.</p>

<p>The latter was a man rather over medium height,
dressed in the very latest fashion, but with a trace of
untidiness that suggested a careless valet. His face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was inclined to be sallow, and the light eyes, prominent
and rather jerky in their movements, had heavy
bags under them, despite the fact that their owner must
still have been under fifty.</p>

<p>For the rest, his chin was firm, perhaps a little pugnacious,
and his bearing was that of a man who fully
realizes his importance.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Lane A. Griswold, the owner of the
<em>Chronicle and Observer</em>, you know, Carter,” explained
the flustered Cray. “Mr. Griswold, my friend, Nicholas
Carter.”</p>

<p>Gordon kept his eyelids partially drawn down as
he greeted the millionaire. It was a trick of Carter’s
when thinking. In fact, the detective often closed his
eyes altogether at such times. Gordon had noted
this, and was making use of it in order to conceal
the color of his eyes, the one weak point about his
impersonation, physically considered.</p>

<p>Cray was inclined to clip his words short, and leave
out as many of them as he could, thereby giving an
impression of unusual directness, and a haste that
cannot stop for trifles.</p>

<p>“Very important case, this one, Mr. Griswold has
brought me,” he said. “Delicate matter, too—decidedly.
Did little job for him once, so he brought me
this. Thought I’d better let you in on it, though.”</p>

<p>Gordon nodded slightly, as if all this was quite
a matter of course.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to hear what it is about, Mr. Griswold,”
he said. “Of course, I’m very busy, as always,
but——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“I understand that,” the newspaper proprietor broke
in. “I’ll make this well worth while for both of you,
though, if you can handle it without publicity.”</p>

<p>Green Eye smiled. “That sounds rather strange
from the lips of our greatest apostle of publicity,” he
commented.</p>

<p>Griswold gave a gesture of impatience. “Perhaps
so,” he admitted. “I can’t help that, though. Facts
are facts, and this would be most embarrassing to me
if any of my competitors should get hold of it, or even
if it were spread by word of mouth.”</p>

<p>He fixed Gordon with his eyes, looking him up and
down, as if scrutinizing an applicant for the position
of office boy—supposing a millionaire would descend
to such trivialities.</p>

<p>But the bogus detective stood the scrutiny very well.
To tell the truth, Ernest Gordon was really beginning
to enjoy himself. Griswold’s first words could hardly
have sounded more promising. They suggested all
sorts of delightful and golden possibilities.</p>

<p>It seemed perfectly plain that this was just the sort
of thing he was looking for—the case of a wealthy,
prominent man, who had something to hide, and was
willing to pay liberally to those who would keep his
secret.</p>

<p>“I can trust you implicitly, whether you succeed or
fail, to reveal no word of what I’m about to tell you?”
Griswold asked sharply.</p>

<p>The man behind the desk shrugged his shoulders
in a way that was characteristic of Nick Carter on
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve been in the confidence of presidents and senators,
ambassadors and noblemen—and millionaires,”
he returned, tacking on the word “millionaires” as if it
were an afterthought. “In fact, I may claim some
knowledge of the secrets of royalty.”</p>

<p>It was all perfectly true from Nick Carter’s standpoint,
but the detective himself would not have put it
in that way, or boasted of it at all.</p>

<p>“Of course, you may confide in me or not, as you
please,” Green Eye continued, warming up as he
gained self-confidence.</p>

<p>“Tut-tut!” ejaculated Griswold, with a somewhat
pained expression. He had come, with reason, to believe
that wealth would buy anything, and he was
not quite prepared for this show of indifference. “I
meant no offense, Mr. Carter, you may be sure. As
I said, though, this is a very ticklish business——”</p>

<p>“We’ll take that for granted,” Gordon quietly interrupted.
“Were you going to give me the details, Mr.
Griswold?”</p>

<p>His cool, almost insolent tone gave no hint of the
turmoil of impatience raging within.</p>

<p>What was he about to hear, and what use would
he make of it—in other words, how much could he
make it yield him in cold, hard cash, or crackling bank
notes?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.
<br />
<small>THE ABSCONDING TREASURER.</small></h2>


<p>For a time it looked as if the millionaire newspaper
proprietor meant to resent the supposed detective’s
effrontery in some way, but he managed to swallow
his wrath, and, after reseating himself and angrily
fingering his watch chain, got down to business.</p>

<p>Probably he had decided that it would be very poor
policy to have words with a man of Nick’s reputation,
especially when he was badly in need of the detective’s
services.</p>

<p>After clearing his throat, he began:</p>

<p>“I have explained it all to Mr. Cray, here, but perhaps
I had better go over it again, in my own way.
The case is in connection with the relief fund which
my papers, headed by the <em>Chronicle and Observer</em>, have
raised for the Hattontown sufferers.”</p>

<p>Gordon nodded almost imperceptibly. The terrible
fire at Hattontown, which had destroyed a large part
of one of New England’s busiest little manufacturing
cities, had occurred while he was still in prison. He
had read of it, however, in the papers to which he had
access in the prison library, and for that reason he
was familiar with the main facts.</p>

<p>Hundreds of residences and business blocks had
been destroyed, with an appalling property loss and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
considerable loss of life, as well. Thousands of persons,
men, women, and children, had been rendered
homeless and penniless.</p>

<p>That was where Griswold’s chain of newspapers
had taken a hand. Always quick to respond to such
emergencies—largely, it is to be feared, for the advertising
it gave them—they had started to raise a fund
for the destitute victims, and, thanks to their tremendous
combined circulations, the amount had soon attained
imposing proportions.</p>

<p>Part of it had been paid out for the immediate
needs of the victims, but most of it, according to the
latest reports Gordon had seen, was being retained
for more permanent aid, to provide work, homes, et
cetera.</p>

<p>What could there be about this fund, Green Eye
wondered, that required investigation, particularly an
investigation prompted by the proprietor of the newspapers
responsible for it.</p>

<p>“As usual,” Griswold went on. “I started the fund
by subscribing five thousand dollars, and many men
of substance have contributed large sums, although
none so large as that. You may or may not know
that the receipts to date total a little over a hundred
thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“A very neat sum, indeed,” Gordon commented,
“and one that is very creditable to those who have
contributed, especially those who have done so anonymously.”</p>

<p>He could not resist that slight dig, for he knew
perfectly well that Lane A. Griswold had never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
guilty of making an anonymous contribution in his
life. He was never satisfied unless his name could
head the list.</p>

<p>Perhaps this baiting was unwise, but Green Eye
did not think so. A little of it, he felt sure, would
be good for the millionaire, and give him a wholesome
fear of the supposed detective. He decided,
though, to let it go at that, for the present, at least.</p>

<p>As for Griswold, after swallowing hard two or three
times, he evidently determined to ignore the thrust.</p>

<p>“But how could a criminal case, delicate or otherwise,
have arisen out of such a philanthropic enterprise?”
Green Eye queried innocently.</p>

<p>If pressed, he could have given a pretty shrewd
guess, but it suited his purpose just then to take another
course.</p>

<p>“It’s simple enough—too infernally simple!” Griswold
retorted feelingly. “The money has been stolen,
that’s all!”</p>

<p>Gordon had suspected something of the sort, but
it was pleasing to hear it put into words. A hundred-thousand-dollar
relief fund reposing safely in some
bank vault was of only theoretical interest to him,
along with the hundreds of millions stored in similar
vaults within a radius of a few miles of Nick Carter’s
study. A hundred thousand dollars—or anywhere
near that amount—in the hands of a fugitive from justice
was a very different matter, however. There
were possibilities in that situation.</p>

<p>“Ah, I’m not surprised!” Gordon remarked calmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
“How and when was the money taken? I assume you
don’t know by whom?”</p>

<p>“But I do—I know only too well,” Griswold told
him promptly.</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“There’s no room for doubt about it. The money
was taken by a man named John Simpson, an old
and trusted employee of the <em>Chronicle and Observer</em>.”</p>

<p>“How did he happen to have access to it, may I
ask?”</p>

<p>“I made him the treasurer of the fund. I never
dreamed of anything of this sort. He had served in a
similar capacity more than once in the past, and always
with the most scrupulous fidelity.”</p>

<p>“But how did he have possession of the whole
fund, if it was collected by different newspapers?”</p>

<p>“Daily drafts were sent to the <em>Chronicle and Observer</em>,
as the parent newspaper of the chain. Our
New York office is the general headquarters, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I see. Simpson is missing, is he, along with the
money?”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.
<br />
<small>CHANCE PLAYS INTO GORDON’S HANDS.</small></h2>


<p>The newspaper proprietor nodded gloomily in response
to Gordon’s question.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, “Simpson disappeared four
days ago.”</p>

<p>“Has he a family?”</p>

<p>“A wife.”</p>

<p>“And she knows nothing about him, or professes
to know nothing?”</p>

<p>“I feel sure she’s as much in the dark as we are.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps—perhaps not,” murmured the bogus detective,
joining the tips of his fingers as he had seen
Nick do. “Please tell me now how the fellow managed
to get hold of the money, to get it out of the
bank or banks in which it had been deposited to the
credit of the fund. Surely, his wasn’t the only signature
required, was it? The checks drawn against
the fund must have been countersigned by some one
else?”</p>

<p>“They were—by Mr. Driggs, the vice president of
our organization.”</p>

<p>“Then how——”</p>

<p>“In a very ingenious way. I wouldn’t have thought
John Simpson capable of so much adroitness. I was
away at the time, but he prevailed upon Mr. Driggs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to withdraw the fund from the two New York banks
in which it had been deposited—the Broadway Exchange
Bank, and the Hudson National—and to transfer
everything to the Cotton and Wool National at
Hattontown.”</p>

<p>“Thus making it possible to deal with only one
bank, and that a smaller one whose officials presumably
were not so wary,” Green Eye commented judicially.
“What excuse did he give?”</p>

<p>“A most plausible one. He pointed out that the
Hattontown sufferers and the citizens generally would
feel more comfortable, more sure of the reality of
the fund if they knew that it had been transferred to
one of their local banks. ‘We aren’t ready to pay
the money all over to them,’ he told Driggs. ‘Most
of them would like to have it all at once, of course,
and they’re somewhat dissatisfied, even though the
more sensible among them realize that mere temporary
relief isn’t a solution to their problems. If we transfer
the fund to Hattontown, however, that will encourage
them. They will feel it is almost in their
hands.’</p>

<p>“Well, it looked like sound sense, and Driggs agreed,
with the result that every cent was withdrawn from the
two New York banks. As you say, that made it much
easier for the thief. Still, the task that remained
would have seemed big enough to most men. In fact,
they would have passed it up as impossible. Not so
our old, reliable John Simpson, though—confound
him! After plodding along as methodically as any
spiritless work horse for fifteen or eighteen years, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
had suddenly developed a streak of lawlessness, and,
along with it, in some unaccountable fashion, had
come something approaching brilliancy of mind. The
Hattontown bank was now the custodian of the entire
fund, less what had been paid out to the victims for
their immediate necessities. As the disbursements
amounted to a little less than twenty thousand, there
was a balance of about eighty thousand when the
transfer took place. Naturally, Simpson then turned
his attention to Hattontown.</p>

<p>“The Cotton and Wool Bank there, so far as I’ve
been able to ascertain, is a fair sample of hundreds of
good, average, conservatively conducted institutions
of the kind of our smaller cities. Apparently there
was no rottenness of which Simpson could take advantage,
and evidently he didn’t waste time over that
possibility. He seems to have felt himself quite
capable of getting that money out by his own unaided
efforts, and subsequent events prove that his confidence
was far from misplaced.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” Gordon urged eagerly.</p>

<p>He was greatly interested; not from the standpoint
of law and order, but from that of one criminal studying
the work of another. He had been inclined at first
to think that the fugitive would be easy to catch,
and easy to swindle out of the proceeds of the theft,
but he was not so sure of that now.</p>

<p>“You would never guess in a hundred years, gentlemen,”
Griswold assured his two hearers. “This is
new to Cray, too,” he added in explanation, addressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Gordon. “I didn’t cover this point when I explained
matters to him.</p>

<p>“This is the way he worked it: After getting the
money where he wanted it, he went to Driggs with
another adroit idea—a suggestion for the publicity
stunt this time. One of the smaller papers under my
ownership, as you probably know, is published in
Hattontown—the Hattontown <em>Observer</em>. Well,
Simpson went to Driggs and proposed that that eighty
thousand dollars be temporarily withdrawn from the
bank in gold, and exhibited under strong guard in the
windows of the <em>Observer</em> office. See the point? He
argued very convincingly that the sight of so much
money would create the greatest possible local sensation,
and give the people in Hattontown an exalted idea
of the importance and power of the <em>Observer</em>. Driggs
offered certain objections, but Simpson argued them
away without much trouble. As a matter of fact, I
have no doubt but that I would have fallen for it as
readily as Driggs did.”</p>

<p>The millionaire paused and smiled in a rather grim
fashion.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, I’ve actually adopted the suggestion,”
he informed them. “Eighty thousand dollars
in gold is actually on exhibition at the present time
in the windows of the Hattontown <em>Observer</em>—under
the eyes of armed guards day and night.”</p>

<p>“But——” Gordon had started to speak, but a gesture
of Griswold’s stopped him.</p>

<p>“Let me explain,” the great newspaper owner hastened
to say. “The original fund has been stolen, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of course, that fact is known only to very few, including
the officials of the Cotton and Wool Bank in
Hattontown. We cannot afford to let the truth get
out, if we can possibly help it, for it would be a serious
blow to the prestige of our organization; therefore
I have duplicated the fund, drawing on my private
account for the purpose, and, as Simpson suggested,
the money has been placed on exhibition. It’s
attracting an immense amount of favorable attention,
and will doubtless mean a great increase in circulation
for the Hattontown <em>Observer</em>. We have that much to
thank Simpson for, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Very extraordinary!” murmured the supposed detective
aloud. “Better and better!” he commented inwardly.
“I haven’t any scruples to speak of, but it
goes without saying that I’d rather relieve this hog
of a millionaire of eighty thousand than take it from a
few hundreds of poor devils who have been cleaned
out of everything. That money seems to be fatherless,
and waiting to be adopted. It was contributed to the
fund, but the fund is now complete without it. It
doesn’t belong to Simpson, and Griswold doesn’t need
it. Obviously, it’s mine, and I’m going to have it.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t told us yet,” he added, addressing
his visitors, “how the missing treasurer actually got
his hands on the money. The bank in Hattontown
naturally wouldn’t have turned any such amount over
to a stranger.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.
<br />
<small>THE IMPOSTOR’S CLEVERNESS.</small></h2>


<p>“You may take that for granted, of course,” Griswold
agreed, in reference to the bogus detective’s last
suggestion.</p>

<p>“But Simpson was treasurer of the fund,” Cray
interposed. “He worked it so the bank accepted his
authority, and——”</p>

<p>Gordon was studying the millionaire’s face, and was
clever enough to read what he saw there.</p>

<p>“By no means, my dear Cray,” he said. “Simpson
didn’t approach the Hattontown bank in his capacity
as treasurer of the fund. He knew better than to
do that—knew that he would have no standing there,
unless identified and backed up by the organization
itself. He knew, too, as I reason it out, that the
bank would look for any action to come from the
local newspaper, and would be off its guard if it did,
the <em>Observer’s</em> man being naturally known to the bank
officials.”</p>

<p>He was watching Griswold narrowly all the time,
and saw that he was on the right track.</p>

<p>“Mean he had an accomplice on the Hattontown
paper?” demanded Cray, looking startled.</p>

<p>“By no means,” Gordon returned calmly, still using
Griswold’s expression as a guide. “There’s such a
thing, though, as impersonation, my friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a venturesome leap, but it proved surprisingly
successful.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” ejaculated the millionaire, looking at
the supposed Nick Carter in amazement and with a
new respect. “You have hit the nail on the head,
Mr. Carter! How in the world——”</p>

<p>Gordon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was very simple,” he confessed. “I read
it all in your face.”</p>

<p>He rightly guessed that that would not make it
seem any the less remarkable in Griswold’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how,” declared the millionaire.</p>

<p>“Some stunt!” Cray commented admiringly.</p>

<p>“I did just that, though,” Green Eye assured the
millionaire. “Of course, I saw in advance that Simpson
would have been powerless unless introduced by
the manager of your local paper, and supplied with
credentials from the New York office. The credentials
might have been forged, to be sure, but a local introduction
would have been out of the question without
the assistance of a confederate to impersonate
the manager, or some one else in authority on the
paper. And if there was any impersonating to be
done, it was clear that Simpson could do it himself.
For the rest, I depended upon your expression, Mr.
Griswold, to tell me when I got off the track.”</p>

<p>“It is useless to try to belittle your achievements,
sir,” the millionaire told him. “I consider it an evidence
of most unusual ability. You have hit upon
the truth in a manner that has taken my breath away.
You are quite right, Mr. Carter. The trick was turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
by means of impersonation, and the man impersonated
was the business manager of the Hattontown <em>Observer</em>.
Charles Danby is his name, and, as it happens,
he and Simpson resemble each other more or less.
Simpson pleaded overwork as a result of his extra
duties in connection with the fund, and got permission
to be away for a couple of days. Evidently he lost
no time in going to Hattontown, and there he presented
himself at the bank in the guise of Danby.”</p>

<p>“The fellow must have had nerve!” contributed Jack
Cray. “Hard to believe he isn’t a dyed-in-the-wool
crook.”</p>

<p>“It’s almost incredible,” Griswold agreed, “but apparently
there’s no room for doubt that Simpson did
the whole business. He was known at the bank, but
no one suspected the deception, and the only thing
the bank people can remember that was queer about
him was his husky voice, which he attributed to a
cold.</p>

<p>“In the character of Danby, he informed the bank
people, and showed a letter addressed to Danby and
signed by Driggs, our vice president. The letter was
perfectly genuine, and had been dictated here, in our
New York office, following Driggs’ acceptance of
Simpson’s scheme for exhibiting the gold. Simpson
had managed to get possession of it, however, before
it was sent out, and the real Danby never got a sight
of it. Naturally, the bank officials did not approve.
The plan seemed too spectacular, and altogether too
risky. It was none of their business, though, and they
finally agreed to an immediate removal of the gold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Simpson had a car handy, then?” queried Green
Eye.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he had an electric outside—said he had
just bought it at secondhand. Hattontown is a place
of twenty or thirty thousand, you know—too large for
every one to know the business of everybody else; consequently,
the bank people had no reason to doubt
his word.”</p>

<p>“How about guards, though,” Cray broke in.</p>

<p>“There were none,” Griswold answered. “The bank
people claim to have expostulated on that score, but
Simpson scoffed at their fears. It was broad daylight,
in a peaceable community, and he had only a few
blocks to go. He assured them, however, that the gold
would be carefully guarded when it was put on exhibition,
and reminded them that their responsibility ended
when he had withdrawn the deposit. I forgot to say,
also, that he presented an order on the bank for the
withdrawal, signed by John Simpson, as treasurer.”</p>

<p>“So they packed all this money up, loaded it on the
electric, and let him make off with it alone, did they?”
queried Gordon. “It certainly sounds like small-time
stuff. I suppose we can’t blame them, though. They
had plenty of reason to think that everything was
straight. Anything more, Mr. Griswold?”</p>

<p>“That’s practically all, I think,” the millionaire returned.
“We haven’t notified the police, or employed
any other detectives; therefore we have been unable
to trace the rascal’s further movements. The only reason
we know all this is that it has come out naturally.
One of the bank officials met the real Danby the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
day, and expressed surprise that he had heard nothing
of the gold being put on exhibition. You can
imagine Danby’s consternation, and the confidential
reports that have been flying back and forth since
then.”</p>

<p>“Trail begins in Hattontown, then,” Cray mused
aloud.</p>

<p>“We may cross it at some other point, though,”
hinted Gordon. “Describe Simpson, please, Mr. Griswold.”</p>

<p>The newspaper proprietor fumbled in his pocket and
produced a photograph, which Gordon took eagerly.</p>

<p>“Seen it already,” Cray informed him. “Face commonplace,
easily disguised.”</p>

<p>The photograph was indeed that of a very ordinary-looking
man. He was a little over forty, one would
have said, but looked older. He was somewhat bald,
wore glasses, which would make it difficult to determine
the color and expression of his eyes, and had a
rather weak, amiable face.</p>

<p>In short, he belonged to the traditional clerk or
bookkeeper type, and seemed to be one of those men
whose chief object in life is to hold down some poorly
paid position, and to cheerfully make hypocrites of
themselves in order to do so.</p>

<p>With that pictured face before him, Ernest Gordon
found it very difficult indeed to credit Simpson
with the cleverness and resourcefulness which had
been so conspicuous in Griswold’s account of the
theft. Still, he knew that such men sometimes had
flashes of brilliancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s hope it’s nothing more than a flash, though,”
he told himself. “If he were to keep up that pace,
it might not be such a cinch to corner him—but he
won’t. He’ll have a relapse, and when it comes, he’ll
be an easy mark.”</p>

<p>He continued to examine the face in detail.</p>

<p>“You feel sure his wife does not know of his
crime?” was his next question.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” was the prompt answer. “That
would have been unwise, under the circumstances, for,
in her distress, she would probably blurt it out to her
relatives and friends, and, before we knew it, the
whole thing might get into print. I have inquired
about him, of course, and she may suspect, but that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“Her address, please.”</p>

<p>“No. 31 Floral Avenue, New Pelham.”</p>

<p>Gordon jotted it down on one of Nick Carter’s
pads.</p>

<p>“Now, will you kindly answer a question that has
been puzzling me for some time?” he went on. “If
we catch this man for you—or, rather, when we catch
him—what are you going to do with him? You can’t
prosecute, you know, without letting the cat out of
the bag.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.
<br />
<small>CRAY GETS HIS ORDERS.</small></h2>


<p>“Unfortunately, that’s only too true,” admitted the
millionaire newspaper proprietor. “Secrecy is the
prime requisite in this case, and that precludes the
possibility of arrest. I want you to catch John Simpson,
though, scare him as much as you can, and force
him to disgorge. He’ll be dropped from my staff, of
course, but, beyond that, we can do nothing.”</p>

<p>“Compounding a felony—accessory after the fact!”
Cray pronounced disapprovingly. “Bad business—very
bad!”</p>

<p>“I can’t help that,” Griswold persisted, “and I’m
willing to take full responsibility. If any trouble
threatens, I think I have enough influence to fix things
up.”</p>

<p>Green Eye’s face was grave and thoughtful, but inwardly
he was fairly chuckling with glee.</p>

<p>He could have asked nothing better than this extraordinary
case, and his only regret was that the
amount involved was not much larger. Everything
seemed to play into his hands in the most unbelievable
way.</p>

<p>Here was a man, who, despite the surprising adroitness
he had shown, was plainly a novice in crime—a
novice with something like eighty thousand dollars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in gold in his possession. And here, on the other hand,
was a man to whom eighty thousand dollars was only
a drop in the bucket, a trifle hardly worth mentioning.</p>

<p>The latter’s interest demanded secrecy, required that
the whole thing should be conducted under cover,
and unofficially. What an opportunity it was! If
Simpson could be caught—and Green Eye had no
doubt he could do it alone, or with Jack Cray’s unsuspecting
assistance—it ought to be a very simple matter
to relieve the thief of the coin in some way, and
neglect to turn it over to Griswold. As for the latter,
he could not take the matter into the courts without
ventilating the whole affair from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Surely, the situation seemed to have been made
expressly for Green-eye Gordon’s benefit.</p>

<p>If necessary, two or three thousand—or possibly
five—could be left in Simpson’s possession, in order
to buy his silence, or to induce him to give some misleading
explanation of the disappearance of the loot.
And here was Griswold, actually ready to pay handsomely
for having the robber robbed.</p>

<p>No wonder that Green Eye exclaimed inwardly,
“Oh, joy! This is almost too good to be true!”</p>

<p>As if influenced by his thought, the newspaper proprietor
broke the brief silence by announcing:</p>

<p>“There’s the whole story, so far as I know, gentlemen.
I need only add, I think, that I’m prepared
to pay you ten thousand dollars for your services.
What do you say, Mr. Carter? Will you help us?
Mr. Cray has already agreed to my proposition.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Gordon did not answer at once, as Nick would
have done, if too many cases were not already awaiting
solution. He wished to impress the others with
his importance and indifference to monetary considerations.</p>

<p>“The affair has its points of interest,” he conceded
at length. “I went up to the Adirondacks two or three
days ago, intending to remain there for a couple of
weeks, but I was called back on urgent business. That
case, though important, is a comparatively simple one,
and I can attend to it at intervals.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll undertake this?” Griswold asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>The impostor slowly nodded. “I’m glad of an
opportunity to oblige you, Mr. Griswold,” he said.
“And, of course, I’m always desirous of helping my
friend Cray, here, if possible.”</p>

<p>“Good!” ejaculated the millionaire. “I’m glad, indeed,
to have you on the case, Mr. Carter. It’s no
flattery to say that you’ve greatly impressed me this
morning. That being settled so satisfactorily, however,
I’ll leave you and Mr. Cray to decide upon your
course of action.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we need not detain you any longer, I think,”
Green Eye assured him.</p>

<p>Three minutes later Griswold was gone, after asking
them to call him up either at the office or the
house whenever they desired any further word from
him, or had anything to report.</p>

<p>As a mark of special respect, Gordon had accompanied
his distinguished client to the door. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
with a smile on his face, he returned to Nick Carter’s
study, where the ex-police detective was awaiting him
impatiently.</p>

<p>“Queer case, very!” Cray barked at him, as soon
as he entered the doorway. “What’s your idea? How
are we going to handle it?”</p>

<p>Doubtless, he had his own ideas as to the proper
methods of procedure, but he was revealing, as usual,
deference where Nick was concerned. His manner
of exaggerated respect made it difficult for the masquerader
to keep his face straight.</p>

<p>“I’m having the time of my life, without a doubt,”
thought Gordon. “I wouldn’t have missed this for
anything. Here I am in Nick Carter’s house, monarch
of all I survey, with Cray fawning on me like a
faithful dog, and a multimillionaire for a client already.
Soft, soft!”</p>

<p>The accomplished rascal had really given a very
creditable performance while Lane A. Griswold was
on the scene, but now, in spite of his contempt of Cray,
he decided to give the latter his head for the time. It
would be safer so, and, besides, Gordon was not one
to exert himself unnecessarily.</p>

<p>He helped himself to another of Nick’s cigars, and
threw himself into a chair.</p>

<p>“You have had more time to think about it than I
have, Jack. Let’s hear how you would go about
it.”</p>

<p>Cray found this very flattering.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, with assumed modesty, “I had
thought of one or two little things. Of course, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
are two ends to be picked up, two places to cover.
One’s Hattontown—tracing the electric machine, and
all that.”</p>

<p>Green Eye made a gesture of indifference, as if he
did not think much of that suggestion.</p>

<p>“The other’s this end,” Cray went on, somewhat
less confidently, meaning the fellow’s home.</p>

<p>Gordon gave a slight nod. “That’s more likely to
yield something, I should say,” he declared. “Of
course, an electric car is comparatively uncommon, and
might be traced without a great deal of trouble. Several
days have passed, however, and that will make
considerable difference. Suppose we consider the
situation at New Pelham. Much depends on that.
Of course, if Simpson is tired of his wife, and has
decided to abandon her, we may not be able to get
a single clew there.”</p>

<p>He gave another glance at the photograph which
Griswold had left on the desk.</p>

<p>“The fellow’s face is against that supposition, however,”
he went on; “I don’t believe he has spunk
enough to cut himself off absolutely from his wife.”</p>

<p>“Had spunk enough to swipe a fortune,” Cray
pointed out skeptically.</p>

<p>“I know, but there’s a difference. I don’t know
where he got the nerve to do what he did, but I’d
like to wager a tidy little sum that a man with that
weak chin and mouth would be too much a slave to
habit to cut his domestic bonds with one slash. He’s
probably foolishly fond of that wife of his, no matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
how much of a fright she may be, and, if I’m
right——”</p>

<p>“He’ll write her sooner or later, or try to sneak
an interview,” Cray burst out excitedly, with the air
of one who had just arrived unaided at the most
astounding conclusion.</p>

<p>“Precisely,” agreed the masquerader. “That being
so, I think you had better cover the New Pelham end
of it. Go and see the man’s wife, tell her you are from
the office, and find out all she knows. She may give
you a clew right away, without knowing it—something
that may mean nothing to her, but much to you.”</p>

<p>“Get you,” Cray said eagerly.</p>

<p>His distinguished friend, as he believed, had just
said that the New Pelham end of it was the most important,
so that here was another feather in his—Cray’s—cap.</p>

<p>“I’ll work it for all I’m worth,” he added. “What
line are you going to take, though?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.
<br />
<small>GREEN EYE DOES SOME THINKING.</small></h2>


<p>That question of Cray’s ought to have proved very
embarrassing to the impostor under the circumstances.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Green-eye Gordon did not intend
to do anything, if he could help it. It appealed to
his lazy temperament, and his sense of humor, as well,
to let Cray do as much of the actual work as possible,
and then to step in at the end and claim the reward
in his own peculiar way.</p>

<p>Of course, it remained to be seen whether or not
he could carry out that program without arousing
the ex-police detective’s suspicion, and its success was
also conditioned on Cray’s ability to handle the practical
end of it in a way that promised to bring the
desired results. Naturally, if Cray fell down, he
would be obliged to take a hand in the game, and the
eighty thousand dollars would amply reward him for
his exertions.</p>

<p>“Time enough to cross that bridge when I come to
it, however,” he assured himself. “Meanwhile, I’ll do
a little stalling, and see what comes of it. It’s safe
to say that it won’t prove so difficult as it looks. Cray
is more or less of a fool, and he thinks the sun rises
and sets in his good and great friend, Carter; hence,
Carter can do no wrong in his eyes—and I’m Carter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>He assumed an engaging expression.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ll have to go it alone, Jack,” he
confessed frankly, accompanying the words with a
disarming smile. “For a day or two, that is. Of
course, we’ll go over the thing together step by step,
and I’ll give you my advice whenever you wish it.
There’s this other case, however, which will keep me
in New York for the present, although it won’t take
up all of my time. You see how it is—it simply means
that I won’t be able to do much running around in
the Simpson case just now. As soon as I get this other
thing out of the way, though——”</p>

<p>“But hadn’t I better go to Hattontown, if that’s
the state of affairs?” suggested Cray. “You can’t
leave New York just now, you say, but you might be
able to run out to New Pelham before long. For that
matter, it’s quite likely that you could handle Mrs.
Simpson better than I could. You have a great way
of getting around the women.”</p>

<p>Gordon looked around with mock alarm.</p>

<p>“I’m glad there’s no one to overhear that, Jack,” he
said, with a grin. “I might get the reputation as a
lady-killer.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Carter!” scoffed Cray. “Everybody
knows you never even look at a woman that way.
Seriously, though, hadn’t I better beat it for Hattontown?”</p>

<p>That would have appealed to Green Eye if he
had had any desire to get rid of his unsuspecting
ally. That was not his purpose, however. He
had a strong feeling that New Pelham was more promising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
ground than Hattontown, and, since he was determined
that Cray should bear the brunt of the investigation,
it was to New Pelham that he meant to
send him.</p>

<p>“No, I think my way is better,” he insisted quietly.
“You will see that later on, Jack, I’m sure. As for
Hattontown, a few hours more or less will make no
difference. You can start for New England to-night,
if necessary.”</p>

<p>Jack Cray scratched his closely cropped head in a
manner that was characteristic of him when in
thought.</p>

<p>“All right,” he agreed presently. “Guess I can handle
it all. You are usually right in the thick of it,
though.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be in the thick of it before we are through,
Jack,” Gordon assured him, with a hidden gleam in his
eyes.</p>

<p>And, with that, Cray heavily descended the stairs,
and left the house.</p>

<p>Now that he was alone, Green Eye leaned back in
the chair, allowed his face to relax into its own lines,
and indulged in a prolonged fit of silent laughter.</p>

<p>“Ernest, my boy, this is the greatest piece of luck
you ever had, or ever dreamed of,” he murmured
aloud. “What a yarn this will make when you retire
and write your reminiscences!”</p>

<p>Soon he sobered down, however, and began to consider
the case point by point.</p>

<p>“I’m willing to stake almost anything on that hunch
of mine,” he decided. “I feel sure the clew we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
after will turn up at the fellow’s place out in the
suburbs sooner or later, and, naturally, I’m not interested
in the amount of work Cray is obliged to put into
the business, or the wasted efforts it involves.”</p>

<p>At the same time, though, he meant to reason the
thing out, so far as he could.</p>

<p>“This fellow Simpson,” he mused, “has been treasurer
of other funds, and has been connected with the
auditors’ department for years. That’s probably what
influenced him to obtain the money in the bulky or
more awkward form of gold. He knew that paper
currency of high denomination could be traced by the
numbers, if obtained from a bank or any institution
which keeps track of such things. On the other hand,
he seems to have overlooked the fact that there isn’t
a great deal of gold in common use, and that a man
who keeps on tendering gold in payment—after the
theft of a large quantity of the stuff—is very likely
to fall under suspicion. That may give us a clew.</p>

<p>“Obviously, the electric machine may furnish another,
if it can be traced. It isn’t probable that it belongs
to Simpson, or, if it does, that it has been in
his possession very long. His salary hardly puts him
in the automobile class, and there’s nothing to show
that he has been dishonest in the business. Besides,
an electric costs considerably more than many makes
of excellent cars.”</p>

<p>The more he thought about Simpson’s use of such a
machine, the more it struck him as significant.</p>

<p>“Why an electric, anyway?” he asked himself. “All
that I know anything about are ladylike little coupés<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>—about
the last thing any man in his senses would be
expected to choose for a quick get-away, especially
when weighted down with eighty thousand dollars in
gold. Why did he choose such a vehicle? What
possible advantage could he see in it?”</p>

<p>Green Eye turned this over for some time in his
mind, stopping now and then to grin, as he realized
how seriously he was entering into the problem.</p>

<p>“I flatter myself I’m giving a pretty good imitation
of Nick Carter,” he thought, with a complacent grin.
“Griswold threw bouquets at me, and now I’m keeping
up the pace when I don’t have to.</p>

<p>“What’s the answer, though?” he went on mentally.
“Hanged if I can see more than one possibility. It
strikes me that the great advantage of an electric in
the hands of a crook would be its silence. That must
be it—silence. But why should silence be of any particular
importance to Simpson? He didn’t have to
use any gumshoe methods at the bank; therefore, it
looks as if he must have anticipated the need of stealth
at the other end when delivering the loot at its destination.</p>

<p>“That’s the problem—that destination.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.
<br />
<small>THE POLICE DOG ACTS STRANGELY.</small></h2>


<p>“The fellow has lived in and around New York
for fifteen years, at least, for he has been in the employ
of the paper that long,” Gordon thought, continuing
his analysis. “Probably he hasn’t had more than two
weeks’ vacation a year. If so, he hasn’t had much
chance to make friends elsewhere, or familiarize himself
with the criminal possibilities of any particular
locality. Hold up, though, my boy! The fellow may
have been born in the East, and may have spent every
vacation there. Better settle that before you go much
farther.”</p>

<p>Impelled by this, he promptly called up Griswold’s
office, and, after a little delay, Nick Carter’s magic
name brought him directly into touch with the newspaper
proprietor.</p>

<p>“It occurred to me to ask you another question or
two about our friend S., Mr. Griswold,” Green Eye
said apologetically. “What is he, a New Englander?
Do you happen to know?”</p>

<p>“No, no! He comes from the Middle West—somewhere
in Ohio.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps he has been in the habit of spending
his vacations in Massachusetts?”</p>

<p>“I’ve already looked that up, Mr. Carter. The question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
occurred to me when I first learned of his disappearance.
Those who know him best, though, in the
office, tell me that he has either spent his little vacations
at home, in New Pelham, or back in Ohio.”</p>

<p>“Then, so far as you know, New England is strange
country to him?”</p>

<p>“It would seem so.”</p>

<p>“Now, about that electric—you haven’t known of
his owning one in the past, have you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not—he was paid only eighteen hundred
a year.”</p>

<p>“I see. That’s all at present, thanks. Sorry to have
troubled you.”</p>

<p>The clever scoundrel felt he was making headway.</p>

<p>“Now we can go ahead with a little more assurance,”
he soliloquized, after he had hung up the receiver.
“If New England is unknown to the fellow, or
known only in a superficial way, it doesn’t seem reasonable
to suppose that he would think of hiding the
yellow boys there. Besides, he must have them
where he can obtain access to them at frequent intervals—for
he would be almost certain to be arrested if
he presented a quantity of gold at any bank, either for
deposit or to be exchanged for paper. That’s his
hoard, therefore, from which he must draw.”</p>

<p>He grinned to himself.</p>

<p>“Tastes differ, of course,” he went on mentally, “but
New England isn’t the place I’d choose if I had eighty
thousand to spend. I would want a little more action
than I could get there.</p>

<p>“Then what? Well, something tells me that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
chap has headed back in this direction. New York
would attract that money as surely as a magnet attracts
iron filings. What’s more, Simpson is on his
own ground here. And the electric car? It’s a tempting
theory, confoundedly tempting! Why would a
stay-at-home shrimp like Simpson think of hiding his
treasure if not somewhere on his own bit of land?
That’s it, I’ll wager! Not a bad idea, either, for, ordinarily,
no one would think of looking there for him or
his loot. The police, for instance, would spend a few
years going over the rest of the world with a fine-tooth
comb before it would ever occur to them to look
for the fugitive at home.</p>

<p>“But apparently the wife is straight, and doesn’t
know of her husband’s fall from grace. He can’t show
himself to her, but he might safely pay visits to the
place at night, thanks to the silence of his little electric.
By George! What if I’m right? What a cinch for
your Uncle Ernest! I’m almost tempted to go there at
once, and see if I can locate the good old stuff. But,
no, that won’t do. I’ll keep on playing a thinking game
as long as I can, and leave the legwork to the worthy
Jack Cray.”</p>

<p>He threw a glance in the direction of Nick Carter’s
safe.</p>

<p>“Besides,” he continued inwardly, “eighty thousand
isn’t so much, after all. If I find what I hope to in
that safe, and play my cards right, I ought to make
several times eighty thousand, and I mustn’t let the
grass grow under my feet, for Carter may come home
in a very few days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>He got up, and was about to approach the safe, when
there came a knock at the door, and, in response to his
somewhat surly invitation, Mrs. Peters, the housekeeper,
appeared on the threshold. She was dressed
for the street, and had a strap wrapped about the
knuckles of one hand.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take my usual constitutional, sir,” she
announced, “and I thought, if you had no objection,
that I would take Prince with me. He’s been shut up
in the kennel most of the time since you went away,
and what he really needs is a good run.”</p>

<p>Just then the detective’s famous police dog pushed
past the housekeeper’s skirts, and pattered into the
study at the end of the leash which Mrs. Peters held.</p>

<p>The animal started eagerly for his master, as if surprised
to find him there. Suddenly, however, he halted,
the hair along his back raised in a bristling line, and
an unmistakable snarl escaped him.</p>

<p>“Good boy! Good old Prince!” Gordon said, in a
wheedling tone, but he had turned pale, and his eyes
were very ugly. “Take him by all means, Mrs. Peters.
His confinement doesn’t seem to have improved his
temper—and I’m busy.”</p>

<p>But the housekeeper was staring from Prince to the
man she believed to be her employer.</p>

<p>“Well, I never expected to see anything like that!”
she ejaculated wonderingly. “Don’t you know your
own master, Prince? What’s the matter with you,
anyway? You are not going mad, are you?”</p>

<p>Green Eye’s hand had mechanically sought the
pocket in which the automatic lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing like that,” he said, with assumed
lightness. “The heat has put him a bit out of temper,
that’s all. Take him away, and let him work off his
grouch.”</p>

<p>Still looking very much bewildered, Mrs. Peters
turned to go, but she had to drag the dog from the
room by main force, and the more she pulled at the
leash, the more he snarled.</p>

<p>When the door finally closed upon them, Gordon
passed a trembling hand across his forehead, and his
fingers came away damp with sweat.</p>

<p>“Curse the brute!” he muttered savagely. “If he
does that again, I’ll have to put him out of the way.”</p>

<p>He had intended to tackle the safe, but now he
changed his mind once more. He was too much
shaken by this last experience to attempt anything of
that sort at present, and, therefore, he determined to
take a walk and steady his nerves. In less than an hour
he was back in Nick’s study, though, and the door
was locked.</p>

<p>He was about to try his luck with the detective’s
safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.
<br />
<small>CRAY CALLS ON MRS. SIMPSON.</small></h2>


<p>It was quite early in the afternoon when Jack Cray
reached New Pelham, and during his journey to that
outlying suburb he had plenty of time in which to
think out a plan of action, using as a basis Gordon’s
suggestion that he should present himself as a fellow
employee of the missing Simpson.</p>

<p>Cray walked briskly through the little town, having
inquired the direction in which Floral Avenue lay,
and soon came to a steep hill.</p>

<p>On the top of the hill the detective stopped to mop
his brow, and as he did so, his keen eyes took in every
detail of the scene that lay before him. There was
not much of it—just a dozen or so houses strewn
about at haphazard in the midst of a maze of newly
built roads.</p>

<p>The latter ran here and there, not at right angles,
but obliquely, in sweeping curves, circles, and what
not. The houses were all different and distinctive
in type, with not a single old-fashioned veranda to be
seen. In short, the settlement on the hill aimed to be
a modern and “artistic” suburban development, which,
like most of its kind, was still in the early stages of
growth.</p>

<p>Floral Avenue proved to be at the very end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
development, and everything about it seemed newest
and most unfinished. At the corner of it stood a small
house of two stories and a half, with dull-red shingled
roof and trimmings.</p>

<p>Beside the door, in big, brass figures, was the number
31.</p>

<p>That it was the only house on the street seemed to
have made no difference to the builder, who doubtless
saw all the rest of the houses from one to thirty and on
indefinitely in his mind’s eye.</p>

<p>No. 31 was very new, indeed. The lawn still plainly
showed the seams where the strips of turf met, and
the gravel walks evidently had not been rolled sufficiently,
for they were scarred with footprints.</p>

<p>Plainly, Jack Cray had not looked for just this sort
of thing. He paused at the gate and gave his red forehead
a thoughtful mopping.</p>

<p>“Looks as if Griswold didn’t know the whole story,
or forgot this part of it,” he speculated. “I got the
impression that friend Simpson had been living in
New Pelham for a long time, but he certainly hasn’t
been living long in No. 31 Floral Avenue. Besides,
this looks like a buying proposition, not a renting
one.”</p>

<p>He ran his tongue along his lips, and a knowing
look came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he squeezed that fund for a few thousands
before he raked in the whole bunch!” he muttered. “A
little slick bookkeeping would have done the trick while
they were disbursing funds for the immediate needs of
the Hattontown sufferers. Some of it went into this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
house, if I’m not mighty badly mistaken, and I have a
hunch that some more of it went to buy that electric
machine he sported in Hattontown.”</p>

<p>Without further hesitation, Cray opened the gate
and started up the front walk to an oddly shaped
little stoop, which gave access to the front door. A
neatly dressed servant answered his summons.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Simpson in?” Cray inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the girl answered, looking doubtfully at
him, “but I don’t believe she will feel like seeing
any one. She hasn’t been very well.”</p>

<p>“I hope she will see me,” Cray declared. “Please
say that I’m Mr. Jones, from the <em>Chronicle and Observer</em>
office, and would like very much to see her for
a few minutes.”</p>

<p>The girl was obviously impressed by this information,
and, without further argument, conducted him
into one of the rooms off the reception hall, and then
hurried away to communicate with her mistress.</p>

<p>With the natural instinct of the detective, Cray
looked keenly about him, and there was something that
impressed him at once.</p>

<p>The house he was in was by no means a large one,
but the furniture seemed to have come from a much
smaller house. The diminutive hatrack was positively
lost in the square hall, the rugs were little more than
patches on the inlaid floor, and the stair carpet—which
he could see through the door—was shabby, and
too narrow for the stairs.</p>

<p>In short, though John Simpson had recently taken a
larger house, he had either been unable to furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
it adequately, or else had been too hurried or careless
to do so.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Simpson will see you, sir,” the maid announced,
when she returned. “She will be down in
a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Presently, the fugitive’s wife descended the stairs.
She was a small, slight woman, plainly dressed, and
apparently about forty years of age, though her lined
face and gray hair caused her to look much older than
many women do nowadays at that age.</p>

<p>“You have news of my husband, Mr. Jones?” she
asked eagerly, holding her hands out in unconscious
pleading, so that Cray could see that they had been
roughened by hard work.</p>

<p>It seemed curious that the mistress of such a house
should find it necessary to do menial labor.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Mrs. Simpson, I’m sorry to say,” Cray
answered reluctantly.</p>

<p>The woman sank into a chair and buried her face
in her hands. There was no longer the slightest room
for doubt as to her innocence. Plainly, she knew
nothing whatever about the theft, although it might
be that some of her worry was due to fear that something
of the sort might account for her husband’s unprecedented
absence.</p>

<p>“It’s hard lines, Mrs. Simpson,” the detective said
sympathetically. “Your husband will turn up pretty
soon, though, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>The wife raised her head and hastily wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>“You—you don’t think that he’s dead, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, nothing like that!” Cray hastened to assure
her.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do hope you are right, sir!” Mrs. Simpson
said fervently. “If he isn’t dead, though, or terribly
injured and unable to communicate with me, what can
it possibly mean? Have they reported it to the police
yet?”</p>

<p>“You mean the office?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Cray shook his head.</p>

<p>“That hasn’t seemed necessary—at least, that’s what
the office seems to think,” he answered. “Mr. Simpson
isn’t in a hospital, though, you may be sure.”</p>

<p>“Then where is he? If they don’t do something at
the office, I shall be obliged to go to the police myself.
I can’t understand why it wasn’t done long ago. John
has been gone days and days now, and he’s never
before stayed away from home unexpectedly for more
than a few hours without letting me know just where
he was. I don’t understand it; I don’t, I don’t!”</p>

<p>“I know it’s tough, Mrs. Simpson,” Cray admitted
awkwardly. “I wish I had some good news for you,
but I came, instead, to see if you could not tell me
something that might throw some light on it. We are
naturally very much interested at the office, and they
thought I might be able to find out what had happened.
Will you help me?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ll do anything I possibly can,” the
distracted woman assured him. “It’s very kind in
them, and of you, to take all this trouble. What is it
you want to know, though?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.
<br />
<small>SOME INTERESTING INFORMATION.</small></h2>


<p>Mrs. Simpson asked the question bravely enough,
but there was a certain haunted expression in her
eyes which suggested that some inkling of the situation
might have come to her. If so, however, her love and
loyalty had caused her to brush it aside.</p>

<p>Jack Cray did not feel quite comfortable. It seemed
like tempting the woman to betray her own husband—was
nothing less, in fact. That was unavoidable,
however.</p>

<p>“Well, I hardly know what to ask,” he confessed,
desiring to keep her, if possible, from attaching any
great importance to his line of inquiry. “Something
unusual is keeping Mr. Simpson away, that’s sure, and
I’ve got to try to find out what it is. I’m afraid I’m
not much of a detective”—he was mentally comparing
himself with Nick Carter—“and, therefore, the only
thing I can think of doing just now is to ask a lot of
questions, and hope to hit upon something of interest
before I get through.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson did not look as if this appealed to
her in all respects, despite her great desire to have
the mystery cleared up.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m not going to peddle what you tell
me all over the office,” Cray hastened to say, noting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
her look of doubt. “Besides, you don’t have to answer
if you don’t want to. I’ll try not to seem impertinent,
though, or to tire you out, and remember it’s
only because we want to find your husband.”</p>

<p>The woman nodded. “I understand,” she said.
“Ask me anything you please, and I’ll try to answer
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk,” Cray commented, and then
went on, after a slight pause: “They generally began
a long ways back when they’re trying to dope out a
thing like this. Suppose we try that method?”</p>

<p>He was playing the part of the novice very well, and
it was clear that Mrs. Simpson had no suspicion of his
real status. On the contrary, she soon showed signs
of impatience, as if she looked upon his questions as
boring and pointless. She continued to answer them
politely and truthfully, however, and that was all Cray
asked.</p>

<p>“You have lived here, in New Pelham, for some
years, haven’t you, Mrs. Simpson?” the detective inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; ten years.”</p>

<p>“But not in this same house?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Mr. Jones. This has only been built a few
months, and we were hardly settled, when my husband
disappeared. We lived right in the village
until recently.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Simpson is buying this on installment, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We have always rented until now, but he
has long wanted to have a place of his own, and just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
lately he decided that he could afford it. It didn’t
seem possible to me at first, but my husband’s salary
had just been raised, and they had given him quite a
lump sum, I believe, for the extra work entailed in
handling this relief fund.”</p>

<p>The woman’s eyes were on Cray now, and there was
a troubled, searching expression in them.</p>

<p>He nodded—there did not seem to be anything else
to do. “Naturally, that would have made a difference,”
he agreed, and was glad to see that Mrs. Simpson
looked relieved. Apparently she had feared that
he might deny the raise and the bonus.</p>

<p>“What a pity this should have happened just after
you had moved into your new house!” he went on.
“I hope Mr. Simpson hasn’t shouldered more than he
can carry. That might explain it, you know. Possibly
he has gone away in a fit of discouragement, after
finding that the place would cost him more than he
could afford. Real-estate people sometimes hold back
essential facts, you know, in order to get a man’s
signature to a contract.”</p>

<p>But he saw that that was a hardly less disturbing
possibility in the woman’s eyes, and hastened to turn
her thoughts into another channel.</p>

<p>“Or it may be loss of memory, or something of that
sort,” he added. “Your husband may be wandering
about without knowing his own name.”</p>

<p>Naturally, that suggestion met with no better reception,
and Cray was obliged to give it up.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much use in speculating about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
though, until we get hold of more facts,” he declared.
“I suppose you picked out this house?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” Mrs. Simpson said with some feeling.
“I had nothing to say about it.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? I wouldn’t have thought Mr. Simpson
would have gone ahead in any such way as that.”</p>

<p>“He never did before, Mr. Jones, but his heart
seemed to be set on this place, and I let him have his
way. The openness seemed to appeal to him very
strongly. I’ve been living in a row for years, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the openness!” murmured Cray. “I can see
how that might have attracted him. Have you noticed
anything unusual about your husband lately, Mrs.
Simpson? Has he seemed his normal self all the
time?”</p>

<p>His hostess seemed at a loss to know how to answer
the question, to judge by her hesitation and knitted
brows.</p>

<p>“If you think there may be anything the matter with
his mind, Mr. Jones, I’m sure you’re wrong,” she said,
at length. “I haven’t noticed anything of that sort at
all, and I would have been sure to do so. I can’t say
that he has been himself, though. Buying this house
on his own responsibility, and in such a hurry would
be enough to show that he wasn’t. Besides that,
though, he has been nervous and irritable, but I laid
that to the extra work he was doing. I’m afraid
I shall have to call him freakish, but nothing more.
He seems to have suddenly developed whims, and acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
rather expensive tastes. I’m afraid his advancement
at the office has turned his head somewhat.”</p>

<p>“You are still referring to the house?”</p>

<p>The woman hesitated again, but seemed to decide
that frankness would be best.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, “that isn’t all. He has got
the automobile fever, as well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.
<br />
<small>THE TIRE PRINTS.</small></h2>


<p>Jack Cray barely avoided a sudden start at that last
remark of Mrs. Simpson’s. He had been hoping for
some light on the electric car, but had thought it improbable
that he would find any clew at the fugitive’s
home.</p>

<p>“So he’s a fool at times, is he?” he thought. “Good
enough! That ought to make things easier.”</p>

<p>“So the bug caught him, too, did it?” he asked
aloud, with a careless smile. “Did he buy a machine?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir! He rented one in the village, but
his idea was to buy one as soon as he could afford it.
In fact, he has had a gate made in the back fence, and
one of those little, portable garages put up.”</p>

<p>“He meant to enjoy himself, didn’t he?” Cray
asked lightly, though the role he was obliged to play
was becoming more and more irksome. “There’s a
driveway at the side of the house, though, isn’t there?
I thought I noticed one as I came in.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” Mrs. Simpson agreed. “That was
another queer thing. I didn’t see how in the world
John was going to afford a car—even a secondhand
one, as he talked of buying—but if he was going to
have one, I didn’t see why it should not be driven in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
from the front, since that was what the drive was
made for. He wouldn’t hear of it, though.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“He said he was going to drive his own car, and he
didn’t want everybody to be watching him and criticizing
the way he was doing it. He thought he would
prefer to come in the back way, where there wouldn’t
be so many spectators. That was ridiculous, though,
because you can see for yourself that there are not
many people living here on the hill. Besides, he would
soon have learned to drive well enough not to mind
if he were watched.”</p>

<p>Cray nodded, but his heart was pounding. This
was certainly a queer whim on Simpson’s part, and
the detective was sure there must be some reason for
it. In fact, he was inclined to believe that there was
a reason for the choice of the house itself, and that
both had to do with the fugitive’s crime. The thought
was an exciting one, but Cray was at a loss to explain
Simpson’s actions.</p>

<p>It might be well to see how the land lay, and the
best way to do that, he believed, was with Mrs. Simpson’s
knowledge, rather than furtively.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to alarm you too much,” he said, “but
these things look rather queer, you know. You seem
sure that there wasn’t anything the matter with Mr.
Simpson’s mind, and yet you admit that he has done
some peculiar things. You’d rather think that his
mind was temporarily clouded, wouldn’t you, than that
he was dead, or had deliberately left you in the lurch?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course,” Mrs. Simpson agreed. “It would be
terrible, though—terrible!”</p>

<p>“So are the other possibilities,” Cray pointed out.
“Let’s work along this line—for a while. Would you
mind letting me see this gate and garage you speak
of?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not,” the woman said, but it was plain
that she thought the proceeding a senseless one. “I’ll
show you.”</p>

<p>The lot was perhaps sixty feet wide, and one hundred
and fifty feet deep, possibly more. The grass
had not yet obtained a fair start, and the shrubs and
trees were very small, although they had evidently been
planted the season before.</p>

<p>The gravel drive ran along one side of the lot, from
front to rear, and beside it, close to the rear fence, was
the little, portable garage of which Mrs. Simpson
had spoken. It was built of metal, as a precaution
against fire, and when the detective tried the door, he
found it locked.</p>

<p>“Your husband has the key, I suppose?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Cray had noted the graveled surface of the drive on
his way from the house, and had seen that it had not
been used. There were footprints on the soft surface,
but no evidence of tires.</p>

<p>“The garage has never been used, I suppose?” Cray
inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Mr. Jones.”</p>

<p>“And no car has been driven into the yard?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no doubt that she was telling the truth,
so far as she was aware, but Cray had evidence that
she was mistaken. To be sure, no car had been driven
in from the front, but it was plain that one had entered
the yard through the new back gate.</p>

<p>Evidently the machine had not entered the garage,
but had halted in front of it, and had then been backed
out again. The marks were not very recent, however,
and at least one rain had fallen since they were
made.</p>

<p>Cray walked on to the rear gate and peered over.
There was a newly graded road beyond, and in its
surface were the marks of other tires—or, rather, the
marks of the same tires repeated several times, a number
of sets of them being more recent than those
in the yard. And all were made by tires of the sort
in common use on electric machines.</p>

<p>“Been here often,” Cray concluded. “Hasn’t been
in the yard but once, but has come as far as the gate on
a number of occasions. Seems to have been undecided
about something, or had cold feet. What’s
more, unless I’m ’way off the track, that machine has
been here not later than night before last, and those
freshest marks look suspiciously as if they were made
last night.”</p>

<p>He actually forgot Mrs. Simpson for the time being,
and, opening the gate, passed through. He had seen
something which interested him, the print of a rather
small shoe in the soft ground just beyond the gate,
where one would naturally have stood to open the
gate from the outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The detective took a steel tape line from his pocket,
and carefully measured the footprint. Incidentally, he
gave the tire marks a close examination.</p>

<p>Soon he straightened up and looked about him. In
doing so, he was more struck than ever with the isolation
of the Simpson house. The spot where they stood
was not overlooked by any other residence. There
was another house within two or three hundred yards,
to be sure, but it presented a blank wall on that side,
evidently being designed to stand close to another one,
which was yet to be built.</p>

<p>“Supposing the fellow had any motive to do it, he
could come here in a noiseless electric at the dead of
night, with lights turned off, and nobody would be
the wiser,” Cray told himself. “And he could reach
the hill here without passing through the center of
the village itself.”</p>

<p>At that point, however, he glanced up at the rear
of the Simpson house.</p>

<p>“How about his wife, though?” he went on to himself.
“She evidently isn’t wise to any such thing,
and yet there are plenty of windows here, at the rear—and
not very far from the garage, either.”</p>

<p>That brought him back, and he rather awkwardly
entered the yard, fearing that he might have betrayed
curiosity of an altogether too professional character.</p>

<p>“A fellow can’t help trying to act like a detective,
I guess, when he’s put on such a job like this,” he said,
with a sheepish grin. “I see right now that I’m not
in the same class with Nick Carter. Suppose I’ll
have to try to keep up the bluff just the same, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
ask some more fool questions—if you are not ready to
throw me out.”</p>

<p>“Of course not, Mr. Jones,” the poor little woman
assured him. “I only wish——”</p>

<p>The detective nodded. “I wish, too, that I could
find him for you, Mrs. Simpson,” he said sincerely,
and added, under his breath, “and for you alone.”</p>

<p>“May be I will—who knows?” he went on, gazing
thoughtfully about. “By the way, where do you sleep,
if I may ask? At the back of the house?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.
<br />
<small>CRAY WIRES FOR “CARTER.”</small></h2>


<p>It is not to be wondered at that Mrs. Simpson looked
surprised at a question which appeared so irrelevant.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” she answered, “but I don’t see what in
the world that has to do with Mr. Simpson’s absence.”</p>

<p>“Nothing, of course,” was the prompt response.
“I’m trying to get at something else, Mrs. Simpson—I’m
afraid I can’t tell you just what at present. Are
you a light sleeper?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very.”</p>

<p>“I suppose your room is on the second floor, there,
where those double windows are?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And the windows are open these nights?”</p>

<p>“Of course—all of them. It has been very warm,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Was that the room you originally planned to
occupy?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson looked amazed.</p>

<p>“Why, no, it wasn’t,” she confessed. “Naturally,
the best bedroom is supposed to be at the front of the
house. It has a big bay window, and gets the air from
three sides. It’s so big, though, and seemed so lonesome
after Mr. Simpson was gone, that I changed
to this back one after the first night. But I don’t
understand what’s in your mind, Mr. Jones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t try to, Mrs. Simpson,” he advised. “I have
an idea, but I’m not free to share it yet, even with
you. That’s all I care to look at here, Mrs. Simpson;
let’s go back to the house.”</p>

<p>They went around to the front door, and the woman
invited him in again somewhat reluctantly. He would
have liked to get hold of a pair of Simpson’s shoes,
but he did not dare ask that, feeling sure that she
would smell a rat if he did.</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” he said. “I have imposed on you too
much already.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and went on, picking his
words carefully.</p>

<p>“I suppose you haven’t got a very good opinion of
my abilities along this line, Mrs. Simpson?” he said
deprecatingly. “Mr. Griswold himself has thought
fit to send me here, and I have an idea or two that I
would like to test. It’s too soon to tell you what I
believe, but I think I have a clew to your husband’s
behavior. Will you help me to find out whether it’s
good for anything, or not?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I will—I’ll do anything I can.”</p>

<p>“Then—it sounds like a mystery thriller, but the
explanation is very simple—will you sleep in the front
room for a night or two, and see that all the windows
at the back are closed and dark?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson looked at him as if she thought he
had lost his senses, but she reluctantly agreed to do
as he asked.</p>

<p>“Thanks ever so much,” Cray said uncomfortably.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
“I know how it sounds, but I have a notion that it
will help.”</p>

<p>And, after a few more words, he left the house,
being careful, however, to caution Mrs. Simpson to
say nothing to any one concerning his peculiar request,
or the trend of his inquiries.</p>

<p>Incidentally, he had secured from her the name of
the garage at which Simpson had rented the car—an
electric.</p>

<p>The ex-police detective’s manner, as he strode down
the hill, was a very thoughtful one, but there was
something triumphant about the swing of his shoulders
and the carriage of his massive head.</p>

<p>In his opinion, he had done a good day’s work.
Certainly, he had made some very curious discoveries,
and if his theory were anywhere near correct, he had
hopes of solving the mystery—and, incidentally, of
capturing John Simpson, and recovering a large share
of the stolen gold—before many hours had passed.</p>

<p>And the best of it was that he had done everything
single-handed. To be sure, his friend Carter had advised
his going to New Pelham first of all, but, beyond
that, the great detective had had nothing to do
with the affair, thus far.</p>

<p>“Carter will be sorry he didn’t get into the game
at the start,” Cray told himself, with a satisfied grin.
“If this thing goes through, as I hope it will, I’ll cop
about all the credit there is. Too bad I called Carter
in at all. If I had known what a cinch it was going
to be, you can bet I would have handled it alone.”</p>

<p>He and Nick were great friends, but Cray saw no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
reason to hide his own light under a bushel for that
reason. On the other hand, he well knew that Nick
would rejoice in his success, and decline to take any
credit or pay that did not rightfully belong to him.</p>

<p>He would have been less certain of the outcome,
however, had he suspected that he was not dealing
with Nick Carter at all, but with one of the most unscrupulous
criminals in the country.</p>

<p>Cray found the garage easily enough, and lost no
time getting down to business.</p>

<p>“Friend of mine, Mr. Simpson, rented a car here,”
he said. “An electric. It looks pretty good to me. Is
it still for hire?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” the owner of the garage answered.
“Didn’t you know I sold it to Mr. Simpson nearly a
week ago?”</p>

<p>“The deuce you did!” ejaculated Cray. “That’s a
new one on me. Haven’t seen Simpson lately.”</p>

<p>“Well, he liked the machine so much that he took
it, after having it out several times. I’ve got other
cars here for sale, but that was the only electric. There
isn’t very much demand for them, you know.”</p>

<p>“It was an electric I wanted,” Cray told him, with
apparent regret. “Like them quiet.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Mr. Simpson said,” the garage owner
vouchsafed. “They may be quiet enough, but I like
something a little faster and bigger. I’ve got a dandy
Wellington here, sir, as good as new, that I’ll sell you
for——”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” Cray interrupted. “Wife has set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
her heart on an electric, and you know what that
means. Thanks just the same, though.”</p>

<p>They exchanged meaning glances, and Cray left the
garage. As he walked along the main street, he whistled
softly, but very cheerfully. The garage man’s
hint as to Simpson’s reason for purchasing an electric
car had served to strengthen his suspicions. The more
he thought about it, the more certain he became that
he was right, and the more eager he was to lay his
amazing theory before Nick Carter.</p>

<p>He desired the great detective’s approval, and his cooperation
in the last dramatic scene, which he hoped
would take place that night. But again there would
have been a fly in his honey had he known that another
had arrived at practically the same conclusion by pure
reasoning, and that that other was not Nick Carter,
but an impostor and ex-convict, who was posing in
Nick’s place.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is just as well that Jack Cray did not
know that fact when he proceeded to the combined
railroad station and telegraph office, and wrote out
the following message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Nicholas Carter</span>—<em>Madison Avenue, New York</em>:
Come to New Pelham by 7:30 train this evening. Important.
Will meet you.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.
<br />
<small>GORDON TACKLES NICK’S SAFE.</small></h2>


<p>Green-eye Gordon stood looking at the safe that was
built into the wall of Nick’s study, and, as he stared
at it, his eyes were very greedy in expression.</p>

<p>For one thing, he felt certain that the famous detective
kept money there—very likely a large sum—for,
in Nick’s profession, it is often essential to lay one’s
hands on plenty of cash at very short notice. Expensive
journeys have to be undertaken on little warning,
often at hours when the banks are closed, for
instance, and there are many other ways in which
ready money comes in handy. It remained to be
seen, of course, whether the detective’s absence had
made any difference in this respect.</p>

<p>This, however, was but a very small item in Gordon’s
expectations.</p>

<p>As we have seen, he was after very much bigger
game, in the shape of the secret records of Nick’s
most important cases, records which he hoped would
be the means of netting him a very much larger sum
than that represented by the missing relief fund.</p>

<p>The rascal’s mouth fairly watered now as he thought
of the possibilities. The possession of the papers he
desired would mean a chance of blackmail, such as the
world had never known. Until now, these papers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
been perfectly safe in Nick Carter’s possession, but
should they tail into Gordon’s hands, they would suddenly
acquire a destructive power far more terrible
than that of dynamite.</p>

<p>What a prospect! Aside from the enormous advantage
which he expected to reap from it, Green
Eye could conceive of no more effective retaliation for
Nick’s part in sending him to prison.</p>

<p>“A fool would only think of killing Carter, or at
most, of giving him a taste of physical torture,”
thought the criminal. “But I can understand his point
of view, and I know that the loss of such papers—and
the use I shall make of them—will be infinitely worse
than death itself in his eyes.”</p>

<p>Gordon started as he heard the front door open,
and moved across the room. He felt sure that it was
Mrs. Peters returning from her afternoon constitutional,
and he wished to give her an order, but he
paused, as he remembered the police dog. It would
be better to have Prince out of the way before he sent
for the housekeeper.</p>

<p>He waited ten minutes, therefore, before ringing the
bell, and presently Mrs. Peters arrived, somewhat out
of breath.</p>

<p>“If any one calls, say that I’m away,” the masquerader
said sharply. “On no account am I to be
disturbed by any one—by any one, mind you. If
Joseph is about, tell him so, too.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” Mrs. Peters answered. “Is that
all?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite Green Eye’s eagerness to get at the safe,
he remembered Prince’s alarming behavior, and narrowly
watched the housekeeper’s face. He felt sure
she could not deceive him. If she had the slightest suspicion
that all was not as it should be, her face and
manner would be sure to reveal the fact.</p>

<p>“No, she hasn’t tumbled to me,” he assured himself,
as Mrs. Peters left the room. “It was not to be
supposed that she would, but she must have thought
the beast’s actions very peculiar. Thank Heaven, all
of Carter’s assistants are away. I’ll have to keep
the butler at a distance, too, as much as possible. I
don’t believe he’s capable of seeing through the deception,
but he’s a man, and he’s been with Carter for a
good while. His eyes may be sharper than I think.”</p>

<p>He turned the key in the lock hurriedly, took off his
coat, and began to roll up his sleeves.</p>

<p>“Now, where, does he keep the outfit?” he muttered,
his pale, keen eyes darting about the room.</p>

<p>With quick steps he crossed to the cabinet and tried
that, but, obviously, he did not find there what he
sought, for he turned away from it with a snarl of
impatience.</p>

<p>The desk was the next thing he examined, but it was
not until he had picked the lock of one of the hitherto
unopened drawers that he found what he sought—a
small black bag.</p>

<p>When he had opened the latter, his lips curled into
an ugly grin.</p>

<p>“What a burglar he would have made,” he muttered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
as he emptied the contents of the bag carefully
on the floor in front of the safe.</p>

<p>There were bits of various sizes, ordinary drills and
wheel drills, jimmies, glass cutters, skeleton keys, acids—in
fact, everything that goes to make up the outfit
of the most up-to-date burglar.</p>

<p>Green-eye Gordon turned them over caressingly, but
it was not for long that he was idle. He knelt before
the safe, his eyes roving over it at close range. Soon
he smiled with satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was scarcely as modern a safe as he would have
expected Nick Carter to possess, but that was probably
because the last thing in the world the famous detective
expected was a burglary in his own house.</p>

<p>Among other accomplishments, most of which had
brought him into conflict with the law, Ernest Gordon
numbered safe-cracking, and, as he knelt before the
massive steel door, with its shining nickel fittings, he
had no doubt that he would be able to master this one
in a comparatively short time.</p>

<p>After a brief examination of the lock, to make sure
that he could not open the combination by ear, the
masquerader picked up the powerful wheel drill, fitted
a bit to it, and, pressing the other end against his stomach,
set to work.</p>

<p>At first the bit seemed to make little impression upon
the specially hardened metal, but presently a little hole
appeared, and grew deeper and deeper as Gordon kept
the wheel in motion.</p>

<p>For the time being, the criminal forgot the relief
fund that he hoped to appropriate, forgot even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
great, unique haul he counted on obtaining from that
very safe, and was lost in the joy of being at his old
trade again, and handling the old, familiar tools with
undiminished skill.</p>

<p>Gh-r-rh!</p>

<p>Gordon paused to squirt oil into the deepening hole,
as the note of the revolving bit changed and grew
harsher. It was working smoothly again after a moment,
and the particles of metal were rapidly accumulating.</p>

<p>Thus the work went on. One hole was sunk to the
required depth, then another, and finally, after various
deft operations, the inner secrets of the lock were disclosed,
and the thick door swung back on noiseless
hinges.</p>

<p>A little chuckle of satisfaction sounded as the door
began to move, but, by the time it was wide open, a
snarl of surprise and rage burst from the criminal’s
lips.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.
<br />
<small>AN UNTIMELY KNOCK.</small></h2>


<p>Despite the opening of the door, the interior of the
safe did not meet Gordon’s eye, as he naturally had anticipated.
Instead, he found himself confronted by
a second door.</p>

<p>Worse still, this second door appeared to be even
more formidable than the first.</p>

<p>Doubtless, it was not nearly so thick, of course, but
the trouble was that it presented an absolutely unbroken
surface. In other words, there was no knob on
it, no combination, no handle, nothing to indicate how
it opened, or where the lock was.</p>

<p>It might open from left to right, or right to left—or
from top to bottom, or bottom to top, for that
matter. Moreover, it was only after a close and most
careful scrutiny that it was possible for Green Eye
to tell where the door ended, and the rest of the safe
began, so tiny was the crack about it.</p>

<p>“Of all the infernal luck!” muttered the criminal.
“A trick door, evidently. Of course, I could blow it
open, if I wanted to do that, but it isn’t safe to use
explosives with a house full of servants. And how in
thunder am I to know where the cursed lock is, if there
are no outward signs of it? It may be on one side, or
on the other, high or low. Have I got to keep on drilling
holes at random until I stumble upon it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>It was all he could do to keep from wrecking the
study in his rage. He had a temper, and he knew it
was at white heat, and threatening to boil over at any
moment.</p>

<p>“This is the limit,” he thought. “For all I know,
there may be no regular lock at all. Instead, there may
be a mechanism somewhere else, operating a series of
bolts which can be shot into the door from all sides. I
might have known that any safe Carter would have
would not be as easy to crack as this one seemed to be.
Curse him! I wish I had him here right now! I’d
make him open this safe for me, or tear him to pieces
with my bare hands!”</p>

<p>Much must be allowed for exaggeration in the case
of an angry man. If Nick Carter could have appeared
at that moment, it is probable that the outcome would
have been by no means the one Green Eye imagined.</p>

<p>After storming up and down the room a few times,
Gordon quieted down a little and returned to the safe.
It had occurred to him that in the absence of anything
like a knob or handle, there must be a secret
spring or something of that sort, that was pressed in
order to set the mechanism in motion, and open the
inner door.</p>

<p>If he could find that, all would be well.</p>

<p>It seemed like a hopeless task, but Green Eye was
master of himself again, and prepared to exercise the
greatest care and perseverance.</p>

<p>First, he returned Nick’s tools to the little black
bag, and restored it to the drawer, after which he carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
removed all traces of his work, except those
which permanently disfigured the outer door, and told
of the violation of its lock.</p>

<p>Even these he cleverly hid by means of a sort of
wax, which he found in Nick’s laboratory, and which
he coated over with ink after the holes had been
plugged.</p>

<p>He did not expect to use the tools again, if he could
help it, and he wished to clear the telltale litter away
before doing anything else, so that if he were interrupted,
in spite of his injunctions, he could open the
door without too great delay.</p>

<p>Another trip to the detective’s desk brought to light
a powerful magnifying glass. Armed with this, the
rascal returned to the safe and began a systematic inspection
of its surfaces, inward and outward, so far as
he could gain access to them.</p>

<p>He was looking for some place where the enamel
had been worn off by the frequent pressure by fingers,
or where finger marks had been left in such a way as
to indicate repeated pressures.</p>

<p>He began just beyond the edge of the narrow door,
and worked his way completely around it, but without
success.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think I’d find it there,” he told himself,
“but I had to make sure first.”</p>

<p>He then extended his area of search, taking in the
jambs of the outer door, and so working his way out
to the exterior of the safe.</p>

<p>He did not waste time over the inside of the outer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
door, for his common sense told him that there could
be no connection between that and the rest of the
safe, except through the hinges, which were not likely
to conceal any hidden wiring or mechanical connection.</p>

<p>It was a long and tedious search. Most men would
have given up in the first few minutes, or at the end of
an hour, but not so Green-eye Gordon. There was
an ugly expression on his face, and his nerves were
on edge, but he kept on with a dogged determination,
scrutinizing the enameled surface of the safe inch by
inch, and going over it not once, but many times.</p>

<p>The fact that the safe was set into the wall gave him
a comparatively small surface to cover, and seemed to
promise success without any great effort, but the
promise was without foundation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the scoundrel’s persistence was finally
rewarded.</p>

<p>He located the secret spring, but did so purely by
accident, not from any help which his keen eyes, or
Nick’s powerful magnifying glass gave him.</p>

<p>The reason was that the spring was located in a
comparatively inaccessible place, behind one of the legs
of the safe.</p>

<p>Gordon had lain down again and again, and, with
the help of a pocket flash light and the magnifying
glass, had done his best to peer under the low safe
and behind the two squat little legs at the front. He
had met with very little success, but finally, having
failed to find what he sought elsewhere, he had begun
feeling about at random.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way, just behind the right leg, and in the
bottom of the safe, he had happened upon a small,
yielding surface, and his heart had bounded as he
pressed it upward.</p>

<p>To his delight, the inner door began to open noiselessly.
Simultaneously, the impostor’s heart stopped.</p>

<p>Some one had knocked at the door!</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.
<br />
<small>THE BLACKMAILER’S SUPREME HAUL.</small></h2>


<p>For a moment that seemed an eternity, Ernest
Gordon crouched as if petrified, his eyes turned wildly
to the door.</p>

<p>Had he locked it?</p>

<p>Of course he had, but he could not be sure of it at
that moment, and, even if it were locked, what beastly
mischance had brought an interruption just then?</p>

<p>Supposing it were Carter himself, or one of his
assistants?</p>

<p>The rascal’s clammy hands were cold, and his knees
threatened to collapse under him.</p>

<p>Gritting his teeth, however, and with a look of contempt
for his own weakness, he pushed the inner door
back, swung the other one around until it was only
slightly ajar, and, after a hasty glance about to make
sure that all else was in order, strode to the door.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he called harshly.</p>

<p>Even at the moment of utterance he was conscious
that the voice bore little resemblance to that of the man
he was impersonating.</p>

<p>The reply, to his relief, was in the butler’s deferential
tones.</p>

<p>“Telegram, sir,” Joseph announced. “I’m sorry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
disturb you, but I thought you probably would like to
have it at once.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Gordon said, taking care this time
to imitate Nick’s voice accurately.</p>

<p>He unlocked the door and opened it a foot or so.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Joseph,” he said, taking the telegram from
the butler’s silver salver, and closing the door again,
but not locking it.</p>

<p>He knew that the hand he had extended was grimy,
and that a locked door was probably a very unusual
phenomenon, but he did not make the mistake of offering
any explanation. That would have been more
suspicious still.</p>

<p>“If he noticed my hand, he’ll think I’ve been working
in the laboratory,” he assured himself. “As for
the door, that’s none of his business. A man doesn’t
have to do the same things in the same way year after
year.”</p>

<p>He hastily tore open the yellow envelope, and found
within Jack Cray’s message from New Pelham, asking
him to come on the seven-thirty train.</p>

<p>Gordon positively chuckled as he finished reading
the telegram.</p>

<p>“He’s hit upon something big already, or thinks he
has, at any rate,” he decided. “Let’s hope his impression
isn’t an erroneous one, and that my dear Carter’s
friend Jack is going to lead me to a carload of gold
pieces. I’ll be there, Cray, you may be sure.”</p>

<p>Now that Joseph had gone away, Green Eye quietly
relocked the door, and, thrusting the telegram into his
pocket, hurried back to the safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>He swung the ponderous outer door to the right,
and clamping his fingers over the right-hand edge of
the knobless door within, he drew it to the left.</p>

<p>He had been careful not to push it completely shut
before going to the door, for he feared that he might
not be able to open it again.</p>

<p>Now open to his eyes lay the interior of the safe.</p>

<p>Eagerly he snatched open one of the drawers, and
gave a little grunt of satisfaction when he found a
couple of reasonably thick bundles of paper money.
When the bundles were withdrawn, he caught a
glimpse of several familiar-looking little packages,
round, slender, and wrapped in manila paper.</p>

<p>“Gold, just as it came from the bank!” he muttered,
snatching up one of the packages and tearing off the
end of the wrapping.</p>

<p>A stack of ten-dollar gold pieces was revealed.</p>

<p>“This will do very nicely for current expenses,”
Green Eye murmured, with a smile. “Now for the
rest, though.”</p>

<p>He carried the money over to the table, and thrust
notes and gold into the pockets of the coat he had taken
off before he set to work, after which he returned to
the safe and began his search for Nick’s precious
secrets.</p>

<p>Packet after packet he drew out, chuckling at the
inscriptions on some of them, then grimy with his
work, and, still in his shirt sleeves, he set out to examine
the records, his chair drawn up to the table, his
fingers shaking with the excitement that possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
him. Once he stopped, and mechanically lighted a
cigar, but it was soon forgotten, and went out, after
which the end of it was chewed to a pulp.</p>

<p>The papers he unearthed were all he hoped they
would be.</p>

<p>There, before him, were the histories of scores of
the most important cases that Nick Carter had handled.
Many of them, to be sure, were of such a nature that
they afforded no opportunities for blackmail, but
there were quite a number which, even to a casual
glance, revealed alluring possibilities in that direction.</p>

<p>Gordon’s pale eyes glittered with greed as he read
names and dates, and all the precise array of facts
which had been accumulated by the painstaking labors
of the great detective and his staff.</p>

<p>“It’s a gold mine, nothing else!” the master rascal
told himself, his hands trembling with eagerness. “If
I have time to work it as it ought to be worked, I
can pull down a quarter of a million—half a million!”</p>

<p>His enthusiasm carried him away into the region of
fairy possibilities, where a rosy light played over everything.
He did not realize how important was that
little word “if” which he had passed over so lightly.</p>

<p>This was just the sort of thing that appealed to
him most, this bleeding of those who could much better
afford to pay large sums in hush money than to have
gossip busy with their names.</p>

<p>He made a selection of the records that appealed to
him most at first glance, then bundled the others up
carefully and thrust them back into the safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“This will be all I will need,” he told himself; “for
the present, at least.”</p>

<p>Therefore, he risked closing the inner door of the
safe, but, lest there should be any uncertainty about it,
he made sure that he could open it later. After that
he closed the outer door, but, of course, did not lock it,
for he had put the locking mechanism out of commission.</p>

<p>Thanks to his care in covering up his traces, however,
it was not likely that any ordinary eyes would
detect the fact that the safe had been violated, and, to
further minimize the possibility, he placed a chair with
its back against the safe door.</p>

<p>Leaving the bundle of documents in plain sight of
the desk, he rang for Joseph.</p>

<p>“I shall want dinner by six-thirty to-night, Joseph,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” the butler replied. “Any special
orders?”</p>

<p>“No, no—the usual thing.”</p>

<p>After the butler had departed, Green Eye hastily
bathed and changed his clothing, after which he seated
himself at the desk, and began going through the
papers in a more careful way, stopping to consider
their possibilities now and then, or to jot down a note.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced long before he expected it,
and, after keeping it waiting for ten minutes or more,
he rose, stretched himself, and, with a little hesitation,
thrust all of the papers into his pockets, to which he
had already transferred the stolen money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“For all I know, I may never return here,” he told
himself. “It isn’t likely that Cray has located
Simpson’s treasure chest, but if he has, the situation
will call for immediate action on my part—and the
worthy Cray and I will hardly be friends afterward,
if he survives. He’ll know I’m not Carter if I stick
him up for the eighty thou, and that means that I’ll
have to make myself scarce, and be quick about it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.
<br />
<small>THE MASQUERADER JOINS CRAY.</small></h2>


<p>Green-eye Gordon, Nick Carter’s double for the
time being, did full justice to the excellent dinner that
he found ready for him when he reported to the
detective’s dining room.</p>

<p>To have asked for special dishes would have been
a risky thing to do, and even if he had had an active
dislike for anything that was served to him, he had
sufficient self-control to conceal that fact.</p>

<p>To be sure, he would have preferred other things,
and his craving for drink often nearly overmastered
him, but he succeeded in fighting it down—at any rate,
during the hours he spent under the eyes of Nick’s
servants.</p>

<p>It was a few minutes after seven when one of the
detective’s cars drew up at the curb, and Danny
Maloney, Nick’s chauffeur, honked an announcement
of the fact.</p>

<p>The supposed Nick Carter left the table, explored
his pockets for the last time, to make sure that his
loot—including the automatic—was all in his possession,
and then went out to the machine.</p>

<p>He was more afraid of Danny, than any of the rest,
for the chauffeur’s eyes were very keen, and he had
had more than a taste of detective work on the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
occasions when he had jumped in and helped out in a
crisis. Nevertheless, the impostor felt that he could
not afford to do too many unusual things, and he had
sent for Danny instead of calling a taxi.</p>

<p>“I’ll be behind the fellow as soon as I get into the
machine,” he mused. “He’ll only see me for a few
minutes. Therefore, as I’ve already stood Jack Cray’s
scrutiny, and am going to invite it again, I ought not
to have any trouble with this fellow.”</p>

<p>He did not, of course. Danny had no reason to
doubt that his chief had returned unexpectedly, and
therefore, it did not occur to him to give more than a
passing glance.</p>

<p>Gordon was dropped at the station in plenty of time
to catch the seven-thirty for New Pelham, a small
suburban place a few miles to the north, in Westchester
County. Both the motor car and the train
afforded opportunity for very agreeable day-dreams
connected with the papers in the scoundrel’s pocket,
and by the time he stepped from the train at the village
he had persuaded himself that a big fortune was as
good as within his grasp, and that there could be no
possible hitch.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that his hopes ran high,
for certainly his daring had carried everything before
it, thus far.</p>

<p>High tide is invariably followed by low, however,
and although the ebb might not set in for some time
in Green Eye’s case, it was sure to come sooner or
later. For wrongdoing is its own worst enemy, and
devours its own children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack Cray was waiting on the platform when Gordon
alighted at New Pelham, and it was plain from
the ex-police detective’s bearing that he had had news
of unusual importance to communicate.</p>

<p>“You have hit upon something, I see,” Green Eye
remarked in Nick’s quiet tones.</p>

<p>“Cleared up the whole thing, I hope,” Cray assured
him excitedly. “Let’s stroll in this direction—there
are not many houses, and we need not be afraid of
being overheard.”</p>

<p>“Lead the way,” the masquerader agreed, adding,
when they had left the platform behind: “I’m curious
to hear what you have dug up, Cray. Before you begin,
though, I’d like to give you a few of the results
I have arrived at in my study since you left me. It
will be interesting to see how near they come to your
findings.”</p>

<p>He was proud of the way he had analyzed the
matter, and could not resist the temptation to parade
his results.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” invited Cray in an expectant tone.</p>

<p>He was thinking of Nick’s achievements in that
line, and looked for something out of the ordinary.
To be sure, his famous friend might “take the wind
out of his sails,” as had often been the case in the past,
but Jack’s admiration was sincere enough to stand even
that test.</p>

<p>The fact that he was not disappointed in this instance
is perhaps the most remarkable tribute that
could be paid to Gordon’s intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just a word or two, then,” Green Eye said in a
self-satisfied tone that was far from characteristic of
the man he was impersonating. “In the first place,
I’ve made up my mind that there’s no use in looking
for Simpson in New England. The trail starts there,
of course, but it ends here.”</p>

<p>“Here!” echoed Cray in amazement. “How the
dickens did you hit upon that?”</p>

<p>Gordon had not meant the word to be taken quite
so literally. He felt sure that the fugitive had headed
for New York, or some place in the immediate
neighborhood, and he was inclined to believe that he
was lurking in the vicinity of New Pelham, but he was
prepared to shift his ground, if necessary.</p>

<p>Now he realized, as a result of Cray’s amazing question,
that he was on the right track. Furthermore,
that realization gave him confidence, and helped him to
fit in the rest.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve just arrived at it,” he said carelessly,
determined to use his companion’s unconscious tip for
all it was worth. “He has been back in New Pelham,
and will be again, if he isn’t at this moment. More
than that, I have a suspicion that he has been lurking
about his own house.”</p>

<p>“For the love of Mike!” Cray breathed, looking his
admiration as they strolled through the gathering dusk.
“You sure are a wizard!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. I simply use my reason, and when
I find two and two, I don’t hesitate to put them together,
knowing that the result is bound to be four.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what in thunder led you to think that the fellow
would come back here—especially that he would dare
to return to his own place?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“I called up Griswold and learned that he had never
lived in New England, and had spent most of his brief
vacations here at home, or out in the Middle West.
That helped to give me a start, and I sized Simpson up
as a man with some clever ideas, but probably timid
and unacquainted with the world in many respects.
I reasoned that such a man might conceive the idea
of outwitting his enemies by hiding his stealings in the
last place which would be likely to be searched—his
own—and once thought of, I felt sure he would
decide on it for other reasons. Because he was essentially
a home body, for instance. Also, because he was
not in touch with crooks, and wouldn’t wish to trust
any one with his secret.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he admitted, “it wasn’t all reasoning—some
of it was intuition, or plain hunch. His use of
an electric machine, though, went far to convince me
that I had the right idea. Its only advantage seemed
to be its silence, and I couldn’t imagine what good
silence would do him, unless he expected to hide the
gold somewhere, without those in the immediate
neighborhood being aware of it. The bulk of the stuff,
you see, made it necessary to use a vehicle of some sort
to transport it. Well, it naturally occurred to me that
the person he would least desire to know anything
about it was his wife.”</p>

<p>All the time thinking, or seeming to do so, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
keeping one eye on Cray, and thus he was able to tell
that he was not going astray.</p>

<p>“In short,” he concluded, “the more I thought about
it, the more certain I became that the chap had hidden
the stuff somewhere within earshot of his own house.
Of course, though, I didn’t attempt to carry the theory
any further. That would have been a waste of time.
Let’s hear, though, what you have discovered.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.
<br />
<small>PLANS FOR THE NIGHT.</small></h2>


<p>The two men had some hours to kill, for they
could not expect anything to happen before midnight,
at least, although they realized that it would be well
to be on the scene before that.</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson would in all probability retire at
ten or eleven o’clock, and as Simpson could—and
probably did—approach the hill from the other direction
without coming through the village, he might appear
sooner than they expected.</p>

<p>Therefore, Jack Cray did not hurry himself when
the time came for him to report his findings. They
walked to the end of the street and turned, heading
back toward the center of the village, while Cray expressed
his amazement at his companion’s reasoning.</p>

<p>That tribute having been paid, he got down to business.</p>

<p>“It’s amazing,” he said. “Doesn’t leave me much
to boast of. I’ve got some facts, though, and even
you need facts to put under your theories.”</p>

<p>He went on to describe his call at the Simpson residence,
and the various things which had interested
him—the new house, the misfit furniture, the facts
that Simpson himself had chosen the place, the hasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
move, the fugitive’s sudden interest in motor cars, his
refusal to use the drive from the front, and so on,
until the subject of the tire tracks was reached.</p>

<p>“Very interesting,” murmured Gordon. “The
garage is metal, you say, and was locked? You think,
then, that the stuff is hidden there—that Simpson
bought the little, portable building for that purpose,
not to use it in the ordinary way?”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it strikes me,” Cray answered. “A
place like that doesn’t seem very safe for such a purpose,
but nobody would think it contained anything
of any particular value. Besides, it’s far enough from
the house to make an occasional visit sufficiently safe,
even in a car—providing the car is noiseless—and the
neighbors wouldn’t be any the wiser. Mrs. Simpson
wouldn’t have any interest in the garage, because she
thinks it’s empty.”</p>

<p>“I see. Just how do you explain these different sets
of tire marks, however? Your idea is, as I understand
it, that the one set which you found in the yard
itself in front of the garage doors was made several
nights together, when Simpson brought the stuff there
and unloaded it?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Then how about the others which seemed to show
that he has been there more than once since then, but
hasn’t driven the car in?”</p>

<p>“Those other prints are the most interesting of the
whole lot to me,” Cray returned eagerly. “It was because
of them that I asked the woman where she slept,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and all that. Don’t you see? This is the way I
dope it out. He left the money the first time, and
maybe, in his excitement, he didn’t keep any back, or
else he’s been spending more freely than he expected.
At any rate, it looks to me as if he wants more, or
maybe the stuff is drawing him like a magnet, and he’s
coming back to gloat over it.</p>

<p>“But right there, friend wife steps in and interferes
without knowing it. He thought he had everything
fixed with her sleeping at the front of the house
and the garage far enough away so that she could sleep
with one eye open, if she wanted to, without hearing
him. Evidently, though, the very night after he
banked the stuff in the garage, she upset all his calculations
by deciding to sleep in that back room. Got
the idea? It has three big windows right in a row,
and as the nights have been warm, she has had them
all open. He must have seen those open windows the
next time he came, and evidently he guessed what they
meant. Anyhow, he got cold feet, and didn’t dare
sneak up to the garage, for fear she would hear him
and get up. That’s why he has fiddled around and
gone off again, and that’s why I asked her to oblige
me by sleeping in the front room for a night or two.”</p>

<p>The big man chuckled.</p>

<p>“I suppose she thought I was crazy,” he went on,
“but I can’t help that. I wasn’t exactly in a position
to shine in her eyes, but if she does what I ask her
to, and shuts those back windows, I shall be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
much disappointed if we don’t catch our man red-handed
to-night.”</p>

<p>“You think he’ll turn up again, do you, and that
if he finds the coast clear, he’ll lose no time in getting
next to the gold?”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket.”</p>

<p>Gordon was silent for a minute or two.</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly hope you are right, Jack,” he
said at length. “And you must be, I think, for it isn’t
likely that we would both arrive at the same point
by totally different routes unless there was something
in it. We’ll put it to the test, at any rate, and if he
doesn’t show up by two or three o’clock, we’ll burrow
under one side of the garage and see what we can find.
That will make it unnecessary to tamper with the
lock, and we can fix things so he’ll never know that
anybody has entered the place. Then, after removing
the stuff, if we find it, we can watch the empty garage
to-morrow night, and nab him if he puts in an appearance.”</p>

<p>Cray agreed to this plan, and informed Gordon
that there was a pile of lumber within a few feet of
the garage.</p>

<p>“We can hide behind that,” he said, “and wait for
him. We’ll be in plain sight from the back windows
of the house, to be sure, and Mrs. Simpson may spoil
everything if she peeks. Let’s hope, though, that she
obeys orders and goes to bed without question.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.
<br />
<small>THE WATCHERS MAKE THEMSELVES SCARCE.</small></h2>


<p>When Cray and Gordon first came within sight of
No. 31 Floral Avenue there were lights in some of the
upper windows, but before they had reached a point
opposite the house, the lights went out.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Simpson is just going to bed,” announced
Cray. “Good enough! Glad to see she isn’t a night
owl. Thought of that, but was afraid to pile on any
more injunctions.”</p>

<p>They passed the house and continued along the road
toward the brow of the hill, then turned about and
paced slowly back. There were lights in some of the
other houses, and Green Eye could see that Cray had
been right in saying that there were no other windows
to overlook Simpson’s rear yard and garage.</p>

<p>“Like to see the wheel tracks?” asked Cray, just
before they reached the house again. “Safe enough,
I guess, if she isn’t snooping around.”</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head. “I’d like to have a look at
them myself,” he answered, “but we’d better wait
for a while and give the woman a chance to quiet
down. She may be peering out of those back windows
for all she’s worth at this very moment, you know.
What you said was enough to arouse any woman’s
curiosity, and she’s probably imagining all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
things. I don’t believe she’s in touch with her husband,
and even if she were, it’s unlikely that she could
get word to him. Still, you never know what a panicky
woman is going to do. She has no man to fall
back upon now, remember, and if she saw us lurking
about, she might call up the police.”</p>

<p>“Well, what if she did?” demanded Cray. “We
haven’t anything to be afraid of at their hands.”</p>

<p>Having once been a police detective himself, he
often found it hard to sympathize with his companion’s
attitude, which was that of most private detectives.</p>

<p>“That’s a foolish question, Jack,” Green Eye returned,
copying one of Nick Carter’s gentle rebukes.
“We’re not down in the city now, remember. We’ll
be up against some country officers, who might yank
us off to the lockup before we had a chance to explain.
While we were gone, what if Simpson should appear
on the scene? Where would our plans be then?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, too,” Cray agreed ruefully. “Might
get away and not turn up again. Take it all back, Mr.
Carter. We can wait for a while—long enough for
Mrs. Simpson to get tired if she’s on the watch—and
still have time to look about a bit, with the help
of our flash lights, before midnight. Not much chance
that Simpy will show up before then.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, they concealed themselves near by and
waited impatiently until nearly eleven-thirty, by which
time all the houses in the neighborhood were dark.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll do a little exploring,” announced Green
Eye. They cautiously skirted Simpson’s property
until they reached a point from which they could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that the rear windows were all closed, after which
they continued to the rear of the lot.</p>

<p>They remained outside the low fence until they
had satisfied themselves that Simpson was not in the
vicinity. Having ascertained that, they crept about
the corner of the fence, and, lurking in its shadow,
approached the wide gate which the fugitive had had
cut there.</p>

<p>Cray switched on his flash light, and turned it
downward so that it shone upon the footprint he had
noted earlier in the day.</p>

<p>“That’s Simpson’s, I’m pretty sure,” he declared.
“Got the data of it, anyway. The fellow stood here
to open the gate.”</p>

<p>“Show me the tire marks first,” Gordon said.</p>

<p>He was trying to simulate Nick’s thoroughness, but
he had a more personal reason as well. He wished to
see if the tracks would tell him the same story they
had told his companion, because if they did not—well,
the stolen gold might prove to be much more elusive
than he had hoped, and the sooner he found it out
the better.</p>

<p>The night was dark. Along the street an occasional
arc lamp spluttered characteristically, but there at the
rear of the house it was very lonely and gloomy; nevertheless,
the two men threw frequent glances at the
Simpson back windows, and their ears were strained
all the time to catch the first sounds of approach.</p>

<p>Gordon’s examination did not take long. Every
mark that he saw served to confirm what Cray had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
told him, and as the light was switched off the darkness
permitted a significant grin of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I see nothing to upset your reasoning, Jack,” he
said judicially. “We had better go into the yard,
though, and see if there are any new tracks in front
of the garage, and then get under cover.”</p>

<p>Cray had noted that morning that the hinges of the
gate had been very thoroughly oiled, but it seemed best
not to put them to the test, but to crawl over the fence
at one side, where their own footprints would not be
conspicuous.</p>

<p>Thereafter, keeping as much as possible in the lee
of the little garage, they examined the corner in front
of the door.</p>

<p>“Nothing new seems to have taken place here,” Cray
informed the supposed Nick Carter. “Here’s the one
set of tire marks, you see, and nothing more of consequence,
not even an obliterated trail. If the stuff
was inside the garage this morning, it seems safe
enough to say that it’s here still.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he tried the door once more, but found
it locked, as it had been that morning. They passed
on around the little structure of metal, keeping to the
side, away from the house.</p>

<p>“There’s the lumber pile I told you about,” Cray announced.
“About time to hunt our holes, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>His companion agreed, and they made themselves
as comfortable as they could beside the pile of boards.
Now, however, as Cray had foretold, they were exposed
to view from the back of the house, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
only alternative was to take a position which might
reveal them to Simpson if he should come, as they
counted on his doing.</p>

<p>“Let’s hope he shows up, and is considerate enough
not to keep us waiting too long,” murmured Gordon.
“I’ve seen cozier places than this.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.
<br />
<small>REWARDED AT LAST.</small></h2>


<p>More than once during the wait that followed, Jack
Cray felt compelled to enjoin silence.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, he would not have
thought of doing so where Nick Carter—as he believed—was
concerned. That night, however, the great detective
appeared to be unusually reckless, and Cray,
on the other hand, felt an unwonted sense of responsibility
and leadership.</p>

<p>To be sure, his ally had taken the joy out of life
to some extent by arriving at practically the same point
through a process of reasoning, but Cray had done
all the work, and was quite proud of his achievements;
therefore, for once in his life, he felt somewhere near
on an equality with Nick, and allowed himself to call
Gordon down for incautious remarks now and then.</p>

<p>“Not a word now!” he at last whispered authoritatively.
“No telling how soon he may come!”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he had reason to be more cautious,
and to take Simpson’s anticipated advent more
seriously than did Gordon. Cray was doing everything
in good faith, and kept continually in mind Griswold’s
injunctions in regard to secrecy. He believed
that it would be easy enough for two of them to capture
Simpson, should that individual appear, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
went further than that, and determined to accomplish
the capture as nearly in silence as possible, for he
feared that the neighborhood might be aroused by
Mrs. Simpson, if she heard anything in the nature of
a scuffle.</p>

<p>On the contrary, Green Eye cared nothing about the
millionaire newspaper proprietor’s desires or interests,
and it made little difference to him whether the man
were arrested or not, if only he could get the best of
Cray and Simpson and make his get-away.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he did not resent Cray’s assumption
of command, for his brain was very busy, and quickly
turned from the contemplation of one pleasing possibility
to another.</p>

<p>He did not believe that a man of John Simpson’s
type had succeeded in spending very much of that
eighty thousand dollars. Therefore, the absconding
treasurer’s loot promised to be well worth having as
a nest egg.</p>

<p>Gordon meant it to be more than a nest egg, though.
Other and larger sums were soon to join it and keep
it company, according to those rosy dreams of his.</p>

<p>Now to the front crowded memories of those coveted
papers he had examined in Nick Carter’s study
that afternoon—the papers which were now safe in
his pockets, and represented his real fortune.</p>

<p>In particular, he recalled one set of records relating
to the doings of a young man of sporting inclinations.
The young man in question was the only son of one
of America’s richest men, and the sporting tendencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
referred to had once got him into a very awkward
position.</p>

<p>Nick Carter had extricated the foolish youngster
without injustice to any one, and without the slightest
hint of publicity. If Green-eye Gordon had his way,
however, the young man and the young man’s father
would soon learn how it feels to have youthful indiscretions
return to roost.</p>

<p>“That alone ought to be worth a tidy fortune,” the
schemer told himself.</p>

<p>In addition there were the Walsh papers, the Gravesend
case, all the tempting possibilities of the Lindley
matter, and, coming nearer home, there were a number
of documents dealing with men within easy reach—with
Chester J. Gillespie, for instance; ex-Senator
Phelps, Bertie Craybill, Harold Lumsden, the actor,
and others.</p>

<p>Yes, there were endless possibilities—money to be
wrung from men who would be forced to keep their
mouths shut, and their banking accounts at his command.</p>

<p>In the darkness, the criminal gave vent to a chuckle,
which choked as he felt Cray turn and glance at him
inquiringly.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking of the surprise in store for our
friend,” he whispered. “Why doesn’t he come?”</p>

<p>But John Simpson seemed in no hurry to arrive,
if he intended to do so at all. One o’clock came and
passed, and the waiting men were still in their cramped
positions beside the pile of lumber.</p>

<p>It began to look as if Cray had been wrong in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
theory, or else that, discouraged by Mrs. Simpson’s
new hobby of sleeping at the rear of the house, the
missing man had decided not to visit the place that
night—for surely Simpson must have known that
everybody had been in bed for hours.</p>

<p>Even the ex-police detective, usually so stolid, began
to fidget. Suddenly, however, his body grew
rigid, and his left hand closed upon the arm of the man
beside him.</p>

<p>From the roadway at the rear, still some little distance
off, had come faint but unmistakable sounds.</p>

<p>A motor vehicle of some sort, well-nigh silent in
operation, was approaching, and pebbles were being
displaced by its rubber-tired wheels.</p>

<p>“Our man!” Cray whispered.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.
<br />
<small>THOSE EXTRA-HEAVY SUIT CASES.</small></h2>


<p>Green Eye did not reply to the burly detective’s
warning, but his hand took a firm grip on the revolver
in his pocket.</p>

<p>He was holding it by the barrel, however.</p>

<p>The brief interval that followed seemed long and
tedious, but in reality it could not have been of more
than three or four minutes’ duration.</p>

<p>Although tense and physically on the alert, Gordon
found his mind wandering. He wondered idly where
Simpson had been staying, and how he dared to travel
about even at night in the same machine in which he
had removed the gold from the Hattontown bank.</p>

<p>“He probably counts on Griswold doing nothing,”
he decided, then grimly called himself to account.
“What difference does it make to me where he has
been hiding?” he asked himself impatiently. “The
important thing is that he seems to be here, that the
gold also seems to be here, and that he’s going to be
kind enough to show me where it is.”</p>

<p>The unseen car approached very quietly, and came
to a halt outside the gate. They heard the faint
scrape of the man’s heel as Simpson dismounted, then
footsteps approached the gate, the latch was cautiously
lifted, and the gate swung inward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Obviously Simpson intended to drive into the yard,
and that could mean only one thing—that he intended
to remove a substantial part of the gold, if not all of
it, and wished to bring the machine as close to his
hiding place as possible, so that he need only carry
the stuff a minimum distance.</p>

<p>The fugitive was within a few feet of the two men
when he pushed the gate back against the fence, but
they made no attempt to tackle him. They felt pretty
sure that the loot was hidden in the garage, but until
there was no longer the slightest room for doubt, they
meant to give Simpson all the rope he needed.</p>

<p>Presently the faint, buzzing sound of the motor
began again, and then the vehicle loomed over the top
of the fence. Simpson was backing it very slowly and
cautiously into the graveled driveway in front of the
garage.</p>

<p>Now the car—an electric coupé somewhat larger
than usual—was in the yard, and part of it was hidden
to view beyond the garage. It was backed a few
feet farther, and then the subdued humming of the
motor abruptly ceased.</p>

<p>Again the two watchers heard the driver step out.
Now there was a new sound, that of a key being inserted
in a lock. The lock clicked audibly in the stillness,
after which the door of the garage began to slide
aside.</p>

<p>Not one of the sounds that had been made thus far
could have been heard at a little distance, but not
one of them had escaped the keen ears of Cray and
Green-eye Gordon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>As they anticipated, the man did not push the garage
door fully aside, that being unnecessary, owing to the
fact that he did not intend to drive the machine in,
but only to gain access himself, and to have room
enough to carry out what he meant to make away
with.</p>

<p>The time for action had come at last.</p>

<p>After exchanging signals, the two men behind the
lumber pile silently straightened up, exercised their
cramped limbs in the air, one after the other, and
then stole toward the nearest corner of the little structure.
Guided by the sounds within, they peered
around the corner, and saw that the open door of the
coupé was just opposite the door of the garage, and
that no more than two or three feet separated them.</p>

<p>They had expected Simpson to begin carrying out
the stuff at once, and meant to attack him as soon as
he had completed his task and save them the trouble
of handling the gold. Now, however, it was evident
that he was digging.</p>

<p>They caught the scrape of his foot on the spade, and
a series of faint “swishes,” as spadeful after spadeful
of soft soil was thrown aside.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the two men to exchange
words, but they turned and looked at each other, their
faces close together. Plainly, it was necessary for
them to wait still longer, if they intended to carry out
their original program and let Simpson do the work.</p>

<p>The garage in itself had not appealed to him as
an altogether safe hiding place, and he had gone to
the trouble of burying the loot under the structure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Some minutes passed before Simpson’s spade struck
something hard. After more scraping and rasping,
the fugitive brought out a box or some similar receptacle,
to judge by the sounds. Incidentally its
weight was made manifest by the subdued grunts
and pants which they heard.</p>

<p>A few moments’ rest followed, and then the man
awkwardly conveyed the box—or whatever it was—to
the door.</p>

<p>The watchers saw now that it was a suit case of the
stoutest leather, bought, doubtless, for the purpose,
but looking considerably the worse for wear, as a
result of its burial.</p>

<p>After a great deal of effort, the far-from-athletic
Simpson succeeded in hoisting it into the coupé.
Would he fill up the hole now and close the garage,
or was there more to follow?</p>

<p>Obviously there was more, for after some further
digging and a lot of sighs and mutterings, a second
suit case, somewhat smaller, was dragged out and
deposited in the car.</p>

<p>“That must be all of it,” thought Green Eye.
“Eighty thousand dollars in gold doesn’t weigh a ton
or fill a coffin.”</p>

<p>He was right. At any rate, Simpson’s actions
quickly convinced them that he did not intend to remove
anything more that night. He looked apprehensively
in the direction of the house, and reëntered the
garage, where, for some minutes, he again busied himself
with the spade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>He was filling in the hole. The clash was about due
now.</p>

<p>Gordon had an inspiration. He had been wondering
how Simpson had previously concealed the freshly
turned earth, or how he meant to do so now.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he has it fixed so that the excavation appears
to have been made for the purpose of sinking
one of those underground gasoline tanks!” he told
himself. “Very likely he’s got the whole paraphernalia
there, and the tank is actually in the ground. That’s
what I would have done under the circumstances, at
any rate.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, his guess proved to be a singularly
accurate one, for that was just the blind to which
Simpson had resorted.</p>

<p>The spade had been laid aside now, and the critical
moment had arrived. Cray turned to his companion
and made a series of quick, expressive gestures.</p>

<p>“I’ll tackle him. You be ready to gag him while I
hold him,” they said as plainly as words.</p>

<p>An instant later, Simpson reappeared in the narrow
space between the garage and the car, and, turning his
back, started to shut the big, sliding door.</p>

<p>That was Jack Cray’s opportunity, and, taking
immediate advantage of it, he launched himself full
tilt at the thief’s back.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.
<br />
<small>NOT ON THE PROGRAM.</small></h2>


<p>Simpson gave a startled gasp and tried to turn, but
Cray’s weight bore him down, and in a trice they
were on the ground.</p>

<p>Gordon showed himself, and approached as they
flopped about for a few moments in that confined
space. Suddenly he turned without warning and ran
around the corner behind which he had just been
hiding. He quickly circled about the tiny garage and
approached the struggling men from the other direction.</p>

<p>The space had been so narrow that it would have
been awkward for him to get at Simpson’s head.
Now, however, he could do so without difficulty, and,
as he stooped, he had a handkerchief all ready to gag
the prisoner.</p>

<p>Cray, he found, had Simpson by the throat, and was
effectually preventing any outcry, while his great bulk
kept the prisoner from squirming out from under
him.</p>

<p>“Now, give it to him!” Jack muttered, breathing
heavily. “He can’t let out a peep.”</p>

<p>Green Eye forced the wretch’s jaws apart, and, inserting
the handkerchief, tied it tightly in place;
whereupon, Cray rolled Simpson over and handcuffed
his wrists together behind his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The capture had been completed in record time, with
no battle to speak of, and without a sound that could
have been heard in the front of the house. Neither of
the victors was inclined to congratulate himself very
much on that achievement, for whatever might be said
of John Simpson’s cleverness in gaining possession of
that snug little fortune in gold, the treasurer was far
from a desperate character to deal with.</p>

<p>“Now, keep still!” commanded Cray. “If you don’t,
you’ll wish you had, I can promise you!”</p>

<p>The warning seemed entirely superfluous, but Jack
Cray knew that gagged men have sometimes managed
to make sounds in their throats which have been loud
enough to bring assistance.</p>

<p>With Gordon’s help, the captive was jerked through
the doorway and into the garage. One man had already
been disposed of, and Gordon was now secretly
turning his attention to Cray, but the latter did not
dream of that.</p>

<p>Jack’s interest at the moment was confined to the
helpless man whose face he desired to see to better
advantage. Accordingly he drew out his flash light
and turned it upon Simpson’s features.</p>

<p>The treasurer’s face was very pale—ghastly, in fact—and
his lips were working convulsively on the
gag, while his eyes were those of a cornered animal.</p>

<p>To an inexperienced person, he bore little resemblance
to the descriptions of the missing treasurer, and
certainly he did not look like the manager of the Hattontown
<em>Observer</em>, whose character he had assumed at
the bank. As a matter of fact, his disguise was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
rather effective one, in view of his inexperience, for
he had been wise enough not to attempt too much.</p>

<p>A rather straggling little mustache, grayish, and too
long, with a tendency to “weep,” had been transplanted
to his upper lip, and proved to be unusually in
keeping with his somewhat weak features. He wore
a wig of an expensive sort, very difficult to detect, and
the rest of his disguise consisted of a few inconspicuous
lines, by which he had managed to change his expression
to a surprising extent.</p>

<p>Cray made short work of the mustache and wig.</p>

<p>“Well, my friend,” he announced, “here we are!
You didn’t look for us, did you? Here are Nick Carter
and old Jack Cray, at your service.”</p>

<p>He shook his head as he contemplated the shrinking
man.</p>

<p>“You’ve certainly a lot of misdirected ability in a
number of ways, Simpson,” he remarked. “If you
had exhibited half as much when you were holding
down your job on the <em>Chronicle and Observer</em>, you
might have made something of yourself. There’s
a big streak of incompetency in you, though. Queer
mixture you are—very.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, while Simpson quailed
under his glance and looked the picture of misery.</p>

<p>“Got any more of the stuff buried, or did you dig
it all up?” Cray demanded, jerking one stumpy thumb
toward the place where his prisoner had been digging.</p>

<p>Simpson nodded despairingly.</p>

<p>“All in the car, eh?”</p>

<p>There was another nod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m inclined to believe you,” Jack announced,
“but we don’t intend to let it go at that, you know.
Have to do a little digging on our own account to make
sure.”</p>

<p>He stepped aside and reached for the spade.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Mr. Carter?” he called out
softly.</p>

<p>But in a moment the other’s occupation was evident
enough, for Gordon was leaning through the open
door of the coupé and working, with trembling fingers,
at the straps of one of the suit cases. The weight of
the case left little or no doubt concerning the nature
of its contents, but his greed had compelled him to
take a look at the gold at the first opportunity, especially
when he had found that both cases were only
strapped, not locked.</p>

<p>“I wanted to be sure this was the stuff,” he replied
to Cray’s question, and continued feverishly until the
cover was raised.</p>

<p>It was gold beyond question—a great quantity of it.</p>

<p>Much of it was still done up in packages, just as it
had come from the bank in Hattontown, but many
of the packages had been broken open, either by accident,
or because Simpson had wanted to feast his eyes
on the thousands of bright, newly minted coins.</p>

<p>Cray looked over Green Eye’s shoulder for a moment.</p>

<p>“Looks like the real stuff,” he commented indifferently.
“Got to dig and see if there’s any more,
though.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, then,” his companion said impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Gordon also wished to be sure that all of the stolen
gold that remained was in the car, but he could not
tear himself away from the sight and touch of those
gleaming coins just then. Besides, he was quite willing
that Cray should do whatever dirty work might be
involved.</p>

<p>While the perspiring Cray was again removing the
dirt which Simpson had shoveled back into the hole,
the master criminal fondled the gold in the two suit
cases, then grudgingly closed and strapped them. He
had hardly done so before Cray announced:</p>

<p>“He told the truth. At any rate, there’s no more
of it here.”</p>

<p>Green-eye Gordon took his revolver from his pocket
and clubbed it.</p>

<p>“Just leave everything as it is, and let’s get out of
this,” the supposed Nick Carter said impatiently, stepping
aside, so that he was not directly in front of the
garage door. “Come out here a moment, though, before
we put this fellow into the car. I don’t want him
to overhear.”</p>

<p>At that, the unsuspecting Cray threw the spade
aside and came out, mopping his forehead.</p>

<p>“Where are you?” he asked, looking about uncertainly
from beneath the folds of his handkerchief.</p>

<p>For the time being, his big hand was protecting
his forehead, but the moment he withdrew it, in order
to see better, the blow fell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.
<br />
<small>GORDON MAKES HIS GET-AWAY.</small></h2>


<p>As it happened, Jack Cray’s skull was a pretty tough
one, and, therefore, the criminal’s first blow, vicious
as it was, did not end matters.</p>

<p>It badly dazed the ex-police detective, making him
totter and throw out his hands instinctively, but the
attack was so extraordinary, coming, as he believed,
from Nick Carter, that he fought with all his might
to retain his senses long enough to see what it meant.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter!” he muttered; then, lurching forward,
peered at his assailant.</p>

<p>The act took Gordon by surprise. He had been
prepared to strike again, but his blow missed its mark
and struck Cray on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Curse you!” Green Eye snarled, raising the weapon
a third time. “Take that, then!”</p>

<p>But Cray seized him in a clumsy, though powerful
grasp, and, with blinking eyes, peered into his face at
close range. A moment later, Gordon wrenched himself
loose, but the emergency seemed to have made
Cray’s brain act with more than its customary speed.</p>

<p>Despite the poor light, Jack had got a near and clear
view of that distorted face and those rage-filled, greenish
eyes. Had he been his normal self, he probably
would have disbelieved the evidence of his own senses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
for he would have recalled the seemingly conclusive
reports of Gordon’s death. As it was, however, he
recalled nothing of this at the time, and only remembered
the peculiarity which had given Ernest Gordon
his nickname.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Green-eye Gordon!” he whispered.</p>

<p>A second later, the criminal’s third blow fell
squarely on his forehead, and he went down, without
a groan.</p>

<p>Immediately Green Eye bent over him and switched
on his flash light.</p>

<p>“Curse you, curse you!” he reiterated wildly, striking
Cray’s unprotected head again and again, apparently
with all his might.</p>

<p>He had no definite intention of killing the detective,
but he was seeing red just then, and did not care in the
least how hard he struck. As a matter of fact, he
was inclined to believe that he had murdered his victim,
and he actually hoped that he had, for Cray’s
recognition of him had enraged him beyond measure.</p>

<p>On the other hand, that sort of thing had never
been in his line. He had prided himself on his ability
to succeed without resorting to such extremes, and
for that reason he shrank from any attempt to ascertain
definitely whether Jack Cray were living or dead.</p>

<p>Besides, he was naturally impatient to be off with
the gold, and away from this place where he had momentarily
forgotten himself.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he rose from his knees, without another
glance at the unconscious man, and, pocketing his
weapon, returned to the door of the garage. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
prisoner could not have seen what took place; but,
as the attack had occurred just at the corner of the
little building, and within a few feet of the door, it
was quite possible that he had heard enough to reconstruct
the whole scene, despite the remarkable quietness
which had prevailed.</p>

<p>That, however, could not be helped, and as Gordon
planned to lock the absconding treasurer in the garage,
he did not anticipate any immediate trouble from that
direction.</p>

<p>Moreover, Cray had, so to speak, introduced himself
and his companion to Simpson, speaking of Gordon
as Nick Carter, of course. That promised to furnish
the basis of a nice mystery.</p>

<p>Green Eye found the prisoner almost fainting with
terror, and finished the work already begun, by fastening
him in such a way that he could not budge from
his place, or make any noise to amount to anything.</p>

<p>“This will have to be your cell for the present, Simpson,”
he informed the trembling thief. “Don’t worry,
though, you’ll find yourself in a real one, before
long.”</p>

<p>And he turned his back on the wretched man and
stalked out, pushing the door to and locking it behind
him.</p>

<p>Cray remained to be disposed of, but Gordon had
not forgotten that fact. He had had no intention of
placing the two men in the garage, for he considered
that unwise, on general principles. If Cray were
dead, as he believed, the presence of the body might
drive Simpson to extraordinary exertions, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
bring about a premature discovery. On the other
hand, if Jack were still alive, the two men might find
means of communicating with or helping each other.</p>

<p>What then?</p>

<p>Naturally it occurred to the criminal that it might
be well to bundle Cray into the car and carry him for
some distance from the scene of the affair before attempting
to dispose of the body. A moment’s thought
caused him to veto that plan, however.</p>

<p>The car was not overlarge, and if Cray’s bulk were
added to that of the two gold-laden suit cases, the interior
of the electric machine would be overcrowded.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the upholstery was rather light in
hue, and Gordon was afraid of bloodstains.</p>

<p>On the whole, therefore, he decided to leave his victim
in the yard, but to conceal him as well as he could.</p>

<p>To that end, he dragged Jack’s inert form around
the corner of the garage to a point close beside the lumber
pile. Then very quietly he began removing boards
from the top of the pile and placing them in another
and narrower pile just on the other side of the body.</p>

<p>When he had raised this smaller pile to the required
height, he began placing more boards in such a way
that each one projected an inch or so beyond the one
below it, thus forming a sort of arch over Cray’s
outstretched form—a one-sided arch that soon touched
the original pile of lumber and leaned against it more
or less securely.</p>

<p>“There!” Green Eye muttered. “Now he can’t be
seen from the house or the road here at the back. The
ends are open, to be sure, but I can’t help that. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
haven’t anything here to cover the openings. All I
ask, though, is a start of a few hours, and that I shall
certainly have.”</p>

<p>As best he could, he obliterated the track he had
left in dragging Cray to the lumber pile, after which
he climbed into the machine, disposed of the precious
suit cases to the best advantage, and touched the starting
lever.</p>

<p>He had not yet turned on the lights of the car, but
the hours he had spent in the gloom had thoroughly
accustomed his eyes to the darkness, and, therefore,
he had no trouble in guiding the easily controlled car
out through the gate and into the road beyond.</p>

<p>There he brought it to a stop, and, returning hastily,
obliterated the tire marks in front of the garage
and such of his own footprints as he could find. He
did not wish to use his flash light too much, however;
therefore, it is quite possible that the job was not a
very thorough one.</p>

<p>Finally he passed through the gate, closed it, and
reëntered the car, which quietly purred away into the
night.</p>

<p>Green-eye Gordon’s extraordinary daring had put
him into possession of a fortune of close to seventy-five
thousand dollars, at least, as well as a bundle of
papers which might yield him several times that
amount.</p>

<p>He had robbed a thief and left the latter an unofficial
prisoner, doomed to starvation, in all probability,
if he were not soon found.</p>

<p>And he had murderously assaulted Jack Cray and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
left him, a battered and bleeding hulk, supposedly
dead.</p>

<p>It was quite a day’s work, and Green-eye Gordon
may be excused for feeling considerably elated. His
work was full of holes, however, and far from detection-proof,
as Nick Carter could have proved to him
in short order.</p>

<p>The question was, would Nick have the chance in
time to avoid a chase around the world?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br />
<small>WHAT THE DOG BARKED AT.</small></h2>


<p>About half past six the following morning, Mrs.
Simpson’s maid, who had slept out, let herself into
the house with her latchkey and quietly made her way
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>As usual, her first act was to open the door and
windows, for the weather was warm. In doing so, she
was attracted by a disturbance in the back yard, and
realized that she had heard a dog barking furiously as
she came along the street and through the house.</p>

<p>She had paid no particular attention to the persistent
barking, but now that she found the animal was in the
rear of the Simpson lot, and acting very strangely, her
curiosity was fully aroused.</p>

<p>She did not know the dog. It was brownish in
hue, collarless, and neglected in appearance. Obviously
it was a stray animal which had found its way
there on a foraging expedition.</p>

<p>Now, however, its original errand had been completely
forgotten, and the greatest excitement had
taken its place.</p>

<p>The creature was running from one end of the lumber
pile to the other—always being careful to remain
at a respectful distance—and was giving vent to an
unending series of frenzied barks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The open country lay just beyond the Simpson
house, and the girl’s first thought was that some small-game
animal had taken refuge in some cranny of the
lumber. Urged on by her curiosity, she stepped out
of the house and started toward the rear of the yard.</p>

<p>“It’s a rabbit, mebbe, or a squirrel,” she told herself.
“Why don’t the fool dig at it, though, instead
of yelping its head off?”</p>

<p>But by that time she had reached a point from
which she could get a view of the rear end of the
lumber pile. Suddenly she halted in her tracks.</p>

<p>“For the love of Heaven!” she muttered. “That’s
funny! Who’s been monkeying with that lumber?
It’s been piled over in the night, or some of it has been
swiped, and they’ve left a hole underneath. That’s
where the mutt’s rabbit, or whatever it is, is making
itself scarce.”</p>

<p>Vaguely disturbed by her surprising discovery, she
approached the spot more slowly.</p>

<p>“There seems to be as much lumber as ever,” she
decided, “but what does it mean? Who would have
taken the trouble to do that—in the dead of night,
too—if he wasn’t up to some mischief?”</p>

<p>Now the dog caught sight of her and came running
forward. She shooed him away, and he began barking
at her, but the barks now had a pleading note in
them, and again and again he ran back to the pile of
lumber.</p>

<p>“He wants me to help him, the poor boob!” the girl
thought, with a pitying smile. “Ain’t that just like a
fool dog?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>But she advanced a little farther, somewhat warily,
and sniffing the air as she did so. Certainly it was
not a skunk that had been cornered, and it was not
likely that the creature was ferocious.</p>

<p>Having finally arrived within six or eight feet of
the end of the pile, the maid stooped cautiously and
peered into the little tunnel. A moment later, she
gave a piercing scream, picked up her skirts, and fled
to the house.</p>

<p>Again and again she raised her voice as she ran, but
fortunately her vocal efforts did not again touch the
high-water mark of that first cry, which, as it proved,
had awakened Mrs. Simpson.</p>

<p>The girl scuttled through the lower part of the
house, and was flying up the stairs, when her mistress
appeared at the top of the first flight.</p>

<p>“What in the world is the matter, Mary?” Mrs.
Simpson demanded.</p>

<p>As she put the question, she clutched at her heart,
for her thoughts had instinctively gone to her missing
husband, and she imagined that the maid must have
had some news of Simpson, or, perhaps, had even
found his body on the front doorstep.</p>

<p>Naturally, therefore, the girl’s information was
not reassuring.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Simpson!” she cried. “There’s been a
murder as sure as you live! There’s a dead man under
that pile of lumber in the back yard! I saw his
feet!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson’s face was as white as her nightdress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Merciful Heaven!” she breathed, horror in her
eyes. “I knew it—it’s Mr. Simpson! Oh, how can I
bear it, how can I bear it!”</p>

<p>And she clutched the banister for support.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, the girl knew better than
that, even in her fright, and said so at once.</p>

<p>“No, no, it ain’t Mr. Simpson!” she said pityingly,
patting her mistress’ heaving shoulder. “This man’s
got big feet, Mrs. Simpson. His shoes ain’ a bit like
your husband’s.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Certain sure, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” the frightened woman cried fervently.
“It’s terrible enough, though, if what you
say is true. Call the neighbors, get some man here as
quick as you can. I’ll dress while you’re gone.”</p>

<p>The maid ran downstairs on the new errand, and
Mrs. Simpson returned to her bedroom. Five minutes
later, she left the house by the rear door, wrapped
in a long kimono.</p>

<p>The servant’s errand had already borne fruit, for,
although the girl herself was not in sight, a man in his
shirt sleeves and with dangling suspenders was just
climbing over the side fence.</p>

<p>“What’s this I hear about a dead man, Mrs. Simpson?”
he called out, as he caught sight of her. “Your
girl wasn’t very coherent, but I caught something
about the lumber pile in the back yard.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson hurried to him and pointed to the pile
of boards.</p>

<p>“There it is,” she explained nervously. “Mary says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
a man is underneath, and I can see that something has
been done to the pile since yesterday. That hole
wasn’t there then.”</p>

<p>The dog was still keeping up his incessant noise as
they approached, and the neighbor found it impossible
to drive him away. Mrs. Simpson stopped at some
distance, and the man went on.</p>

<p>He, too, stopped and peered into the opening under
the pile, but laid his hand on it in order to do so. After
a prolonged scrutiny, he straightened up.</p>

<p>“There’s a man under there,” he said soberly. “You
had better go to the house, Mrs. Simpson. This is no
place for you.”</p>

<p>Confronted by this emergency, however, the fugitive’s
wife showed unexpected courage.</p>

<p>“I shall do nothing of the sort,” she said. “The
poor fellow may not be dead yet, for all we know, and
unless the sight is too terrible, I shall remain to help
you. Besides, he’ll have to be brought into the house,
anyway, so why shouldn’t I see him now?”</p>

<p>“Of course, if you feel that way about it, Mrs. Simpson,
stay, by all means,” the neighbor replied, turning
and beginning to throw the boards back.</p>

<p>In half a minute he was joined by a couple of other
men, while the maid and several other women appeared.
These latter kept at a distance, however, and,
in response to their urgings, Mrs. Simpson joined
them.</p>

<p>The combined efforts of the men resulted in uncovering
Cray’s body in almost no time. The sight that
met the rescuers’ gaze was a distressing one, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
detective’s face was battered and bloody, and there did
not appear at first to be any life in his big body. One
of the men examined him, however, and presently announced
that he was still alive.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t give much for his chances,” he said,
shaking his head, “but he isn’t dead, that’s certain.
I’ll go for Doctor Lord.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.
<br />
<small>“THE GREENISH EYES!”</small></h2>


<p>Doctor Lord was a young man, with next to no
practice, who had recently moved into one of the new
houses on the hill. It was easier, therefore, to go for
him in person than to stop to telephone.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the women were reassured and
thrilled by the announcement that Cray still lived, and
Mrs. Simpson at once took steps to care for him.</p>

<p>She had sent the maid to the house for a basin
of warm water and some towels. With these at hand,
Mrs. Simpson herself knelt beside the unfortunate
man and tenderly wiped the blood from his forehead
and face.</p>

<p>Not until then had she recognized him, but when
she did so, she gave a great start, and an audible gasp
escaped her.</p>

<p>The other women were crowding around then, and
her behavior was not lost on them.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” they demanded. “Do you
actually know him?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson bitterly regretted her display of emotion.
Fear seemed to be squeezing her heart with icy
fingers. In the background of her mind a foreboding
had been lurking for days. Her instincts had told her
that there was something strange and sinister about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
her husband’s disappearance—something which the
office had not seen fit to reveal to her.</p>

<p>Now she recalled all of Cray’s strange questions
and stranger actions.</p>

<p>“He’s a detective!” she told herself. “I was right.
John is in trouble, and this man must have set a trap
for him last night. If he dies, John will be his murderer.
Oh, how could he do it! And Heaven pity me,
how can I stand it!”</p>

<p>She was the soul of honor herself, however, and
simply did not know how to lie.</p>

<p>“Yes, I recognize him now,” she admitted reluctantly.
“I never saw him until yesterday, though, and
I don’t know what he was doing here last night—if
he was here. He’s a Mr. Jones from my husband’s
office, and he said they had sent him to see if he could
help find Mr. Simpson.”</p>

<p>The young doctor arrived at that juncture, and, at
his request, Mrs. Simpson repeated the information
for his benefit as he worked over Cray.</p>

<p>“You don’t know where he lives, then, or anything
about his people?”</p>

<p>“No, but they would naturally know about that at
the newspaper office, wouldn’t they?”</p>

<p>“That’s true. You had better telephone there, then—or
somebody had. This poor fellow has had a terrible
battering. Fortunately his skull is very tough,
but though I can’t be sure at present, I fear it has been
fractured, in spite of that. If so, the outcome is problematical,
and he may not recover in any case.”</p>

<p>He rose to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the first thing to do is to get him into the
house,” he declared. “Have you a bed or a couch on
the first floor, Mrs. Simpson?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s a couch, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Good! Make that ready for him, then, and we’ll
bring him right in.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson and the maid rushed away to do the
young physician’s bidding, and several women accompanied
them. The men waited for perhaps five minutes,
in order to allow time to get the couch in readiness.
Then they lifted Cray’s inert bulk as carefully
as they could and bore it slowly toward the house.</p>

<p>It was no easy task, for the detective weighed close
to two hundred pounds, but their united efforts were
equal to it, and the unconscious man was soon lying,
partially undressed, on the comfortable couch in one
of the lower rooms.</p>

<p>A little later, every one had left the house, with
the exception of the doctor, who continued to work
over Cray for some time.</p>

<p>“I’ve done all I can at present, Mrs. Simpson,” he
announced finally. “If you don’t mind, though, I’ll
stay with him for the present, so that I shall be on hand
if any change comes.”</p>

<p>He paused and smiled frankly.</p>

<p>“You see, I’m not overburdened with practice,” he
explained, “and under the circumstances, I’m inclined
to make as much out of this case as I can—in the way
of experience, I mean.”</p>

<p>That promised to relieve the woman of a great
deal of responsibility, and she accepted the suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
readily enough, although she would have preferred,
if possible, that no outsider should have access to the
patient.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you had better telephone to the office,
though, before breakfast,” the doctor went on. “As
yet, there’s no knowing how this case is going to turn
out, and this poor fellow’s friends may live out of
New York, in some other direction. In that case,
there’s a possibility that it will take hours for them to
reach here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll telephone at once,” Mrs. Simpson assured him,
“and, meanwhile, Mary will be getting breakfast. You
must join me in the dining room, doctor, or let her
bring you something here.”</p>

<p>She intended to play the part that had been thrust
upon her as well as she could, even though her mind
was filled with all sorts of tragic possibilities.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was a telephone in the house, and,
after considerable delay, Mrs. Simpson got in touch
with the office of the New York <em>Chronicle and Observer</em>.
To her regret, however, she could find no
one who knew anything about an employee by the
name of Jones who answered her description.</p>

<p>It was explained, however, that the hour was a very
early one, and that the business offices would not be
open until eight-thirty.</p>

<p>“This is the editorial department,” the man at the
other end assured her, “and we don’t know much about
the other branches. I’ll make a note of it, though,
and of your telephone number, and have the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
brought to the attention of the general manager when
he arrives.”</p>

<p>“I—I think it might be well to inform Mr. Griswold
himself,” the woman ventured to suggest. “Mr.
Jones told me yesterday that Mr. Griswold had sent
him. I don’t know whether he meant it literally or
not, but——”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll do everything I can, Mrs. Simpson,” the
editor promised, and with that she had to be content.</p>

<p>Doctor Lord was plainly disappointed at the news,
but seemed to have nothing better to suggest.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty early,” he admitted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson finished dressing, and she and the
young physician breakfasted together, after which he
returned to Cray’s side, while his hostess busied herself
with some of her morning duties.</p>

<p>Lord was a practical, unimaginative young man,
and therefore, although he was greatly interested in
the case from a professional standpoint, he did not
waste much time in speculation regarding it. That
was for the local authorities to do. He would not
have been human, however, had he not pricked up his
ears when his patient, after showing various signs of
returning life, began to move uneasily, and to mutter.</p>

<p>The doctor was able to make out two names, which
were repeated over and over again.</p>

<p>The names were “Gordon” and “Nick Carter.”</p>

<p>“Nick Carter!” muttered the listener. “That’s
queer! That must be the well-known New York detective.
What the dickens has this fellow got to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
with him, though, unless he has done something wrong,
and Carter is after him?”</p>

<p>Then he remembered the rumors that were flying
all about in the neighborhood—rumors which hinted
that there was something queer about John Simpson’s
unexplained absence.</p>

<p>“This is getting interesting!” Doctor Lord told
himself meditatively.</p>

<p>“Nick Carter!” Cray muttered again, and this time
he added: “The eyes—the greenish eyes!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.
<br />
<small>MRS. SIMPSON LEARNS THE TRUTH.</small></h2>


<p>Lane A. Griswold’s big car hummed softly to itself
as it climbed the hill from the village of New Pelham,
and stopped in front of No. 31 Floral Avenue.</p>

<p>The millionaire newspaper proprietor was on a
strange errand, and his expression showed that he
realized it.</p>

<p>Although he was frequently absent from his luxurious
suite of private offices in the <em>Chronicle and Observer</em>
building for weeks at a time, he had walked in
that morning promptly at nine o’clock, instead of ten
or eleven, as was his usual habit when in town.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, he was in possession of such
facts as his general manager and the editor could give
him concerning Mrs. Simpson’s phone message. The
manager, of course, informed him that no such person
was employed in the building, but the description had
set Griswold to thinking.</p>

<p>“I’ll call her up myself,” was the unexpected announcement
which had sent his subordinates about
their business. The connection was quickly made, but
the conversation which had ensued was very brief.</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson described Jones’ visit of the day
before in a very few words, and then told of the finding
of the injured man. Griswold wanted to ask her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to describe the latter once more for his benefit, but
refrained, thinking the request might seem rather
strange.</p>

<p>“I see,” he answered, instead. “I think I had better
come up to the house myself, Mrs. Simpson. I
shall start at once, and ought to be there in an hour, I
should say.”</p>

<p>Less than that time had been required for the trip,
and now the millionaire stepped out of the car and
approached the house, looking about him rather critically
as he did so.</p>

<p>He had not always been wealthy, and he knew that
No. 31 Floral Avenue, though insignificant enough
from his present standpoint, was not the sort of place
that a man dependent on the salary of the size of John
Simpson’s was able to afford. Accordingly, therefore,
he came to the same conclusion that Jack Cray
had reached the previous day.</p>

<p>“By Heaven!” he muttered, the skin under his jaws
tightening. “The fellow must have been helping himself
from the fund before he decamped. What a fool
he is! What fools they always are to make a big
showing on nothing. Don’t they know what a telltale
performance it is?” Then he smiled a little grimly
and shrugged his shoulders. “I suppose, though, it’s
natural that they should want to find some outlet for
the money they’ve sold their souls for,” he added
mentally, as he pressed the button of the electric bell.</p>

<p>The maid presently opened the door, and Griswold
gave his name. He was ushered into the same room
in which Cray had been conducted less than twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
hours before, and in hardly more than a minute
Mrs. Simpson joined him.</p>

<p>Griswold looked at her with a touch of curiosity,
for to him the members of his staff had always been
little more than the cogs in the great machine that he
drove, and it was rather hard for him to think of them
in any intimately human relationship.</p>

<p>As soon as their first formal greetings were over, he
came to the point at once.</p>

<p>“I’m very much interested—after a fashion—in this
man Jones, Mrs. Simpson. Are you sure you made no
mistake in the name?”</p>

<p>“Quite, Mr. Griswold,” the missing treasurer’s wife
replied positively. “That’s certainly the name he gave
me yesterday. He said you had sent him, too. He
asked me all sorts of questions about Mr. Simpson
and the house and myself—very strange questions,
some of them. He even requested me to show him
about the place. I do hope——”</p>

<p>Lane Griswold held up one carefully manicured
hand.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, I think, Mrs. Simpson,” he hastened
to assure her. “If he’s the man I think he is, he was
quite justified in saying I sent him. Apparently, however,
he didn’t choose to give his own name, which
seems to have been a rather useless and unlooked-for
performance. Describe him, please.”</p>

<p>The woman did so, and Griswold nodded once or
twice during the description.</p>

<p>“That’s the man,” he admitted. “The name has
caused some confusion, however, and the rest was due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to the fact that he isn’t regularly employed at the
office, but works for me personally.”</p>

<p>He was studying Mrs. Simpson’s face intently, and
trying to decide whether it were worth while to continue
the deception or not. Surely, if she had any
intelligence, she must have suspected long before that
there was something very queer about her husband’s
disappearance. Still, so long as she did not insist upon
the truth, he thought it best not to be too definite.</p>

<p>“I hope Mr.—er—Jones isn’t badly injured?” he
said.</p>

<p>“He’s still unconscious, sir, and the doctor seems to
be afraid that his skull may be fractured. If he has
any relatives, Doctor Lord thinks that they should
be notified at once.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about his family affairs,” Griswold
said, a trifle impatiently. “My impression is that he’s
alone in the world, but I may be mistaken. May I see
him?”</p>

<p>“Of course. He’s here on the first floor. They did
not wait to take him upstairs. This way, please, Mr.
Griswold.”</p>

<p>And she led the way to the room in which the battered
detective lay, drawing back, however, at the
threshold. The young doctor was still there, largely,
perhaps, for want of something better to do.</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson had said that the patient was unconscious,
thereby giving Griswold a somewhat mistaken
idea. Certainly Cray had not returned to normal consciousness,
but he was by no means in the motionless
stupor the newspaper proprietor had looked for. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
his informant had told him that Jack was delirious, he
would have been better prepared.</p>

<p>Nick’s burly friend was tossing restlessly to and
fro—at least, his head and arms were—and just as
Griswold came to a halt and looked down at him, he
uttered two words which had come frequently to his
lips that morning.</p>

<p>“Nick Carter,” he muttered, in a somewhat muffled,
but perfectly distinct voice.</p>

<p>“He has been repeating that name at intervals for
hours,” the young doctor remarked. “It must be the
detective, don’t you suppose?”</p>

<p>Griswold was under the impression that Mrs. Simpson
had withdrawn, but even that did not entirely explain
the slip that followed. He who had desired secrecy
above all things must have forgotten himself for
the time being.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s the detective,” he answered in a matter-of-fact
tone. “This man is himself a detective, and
they were working together on——”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly as a cry from the doorway
reached him. Mrs. Simpson had heard what he said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.
<br />
<small>THE MILLIONAIRE PLAYS SLEUTH.</small></h2>


<p>As we have seen, the missing man’s wife had always
had an uncomfortable feeling that all was not as it
should be. Her husband had not been himself for
some time before his disappearance, and the sudden
fit of extravagance which had led him to take the new
house on such short notice, and to talk about buying
a car, had aroused suspicions, which she had loyally
tried to tread under foot.</p>

<p>Naturally, therefore, his actual flight, and the
strange attitude of those connected with the newspaper—their
unwillingness to have her go to the police, for
instance—had worried her greatly, although she had
succeeded again and again in arguing herself into a
belief that there was some other explanation.</p>

<p>Now, after hearing Lane Griswold’s unguarded
statement, there was no longer any room for doubt in
her mind. She staggered forward half blindly, and,
forgetting the doctor, or ignoring him, she laid both
trembling hands on Griswold’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“My—my husband!” she stammered. “Then he—took——”</p>

<p>The newspaper proprietor lowered his head.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered soberly. “I’ve tried to keep
the truth from you as long as I could, Mrs. Simpson.
I thought you were out of earshot. You must try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
bear up under it. If I had had any intention of prosecuting
Simpson for making away with the relief fund
he was handling, this whole affair would not have been
conducted with any such secrecy. I have hired private
detectives to investigate, because I wished to keep
things quiet, in order that the reputation of the <em>Chronicle
and Observer</em> might not be tarnished.”</p>

<p>“Then, if they catch John, he’ll not be arrested? Is
that what you mean?”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” he answered. “I must confess, Mrs.
Simpson, that I shall not approve in every way of such
an outcome. I believe in just punishment. As it happens,
however, we’re not in a position to punish your
husband without starting a lot of injurious gossip
about the way we handle public contributions. Therefore,
when Simpson is found, he’ll merely be forced
to disgorge. His discharge is already awaiting him
on his desk, of course. Beyond that, I shall do nothing.”</p>

<p>As may be imagined, Mrs. Simpson’s emotions were
chaotic. Her horror at the certainty of her husband’s
crime had been succeeded by loving anguish, as she pictured
his arrest and punishment. Now she was greatly
relieved to hear that there was no danger of this; but,
on the other hand, her heart bled as she realized what
it would necessarily mean to them both, at best. He
was no longer a young man, and had been able to save
very little. His disgrace and the loss of his position
would almost certainly age him greatly, perhaps cause
a complete breakdown. Nothing but misery seemed in
prospect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I thank you, but I’m in—in no condition to
remain!” the poor woman sobbed, and, turning on her
heel, precipitately left the room and fled upstairs.</p>

<p>Griswold and the doctor exchanged glances. The
former was as sorry for Mrs. Simpson as he could
be in his own way.</p>

<p>“You’ll treat this as strictly confidential, I’m sure,”
the millionaire said. “You must see the importance
of secrecy to us, and so long as there can be no prosecution,
there’s no use in making that poor woman’s
life more of a burden to her than is unavoidable.
There’ll be a lot of gossip here, anyway, I suppose, but
we must do all we can to minimize it.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you perfectly, sir, and you may count
on me,” Doctor Lord declared sincerely.</p>

<p>“Thank you. Now, tell me, please, what you make
of this man’s injuries, and what you know of the circumstances?”</p>

<p>The doctor’s reply was a rather lengthy one.</p>

<p>“There must have been several blows, and they
were very severe,” he concluded. “I should say that
they were delivered by a man of unusual strength.”</p>

<p>“That’s interesting,” Griswold said, with a change
of expression. “You don’t believe, then, that a man
of slight build, who had spent practically all of his life
in an office, could have perpetrated the assault?”</p>

<p>Doctor Lord shook his head emphatically. “That’s
extremely unlikely,” he replied. “In fact, I venture
to say that it’s quite impossible.”</p>

<p>“Then, it’s hard to explain,” Griswold muttered.
“Apparently Cray found some reason to hang about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
here last night, presumably to catch Simpson, or to
recover the missing gold. If he was knocked out by
an unusually powerful man, the only reasonable conclusion,
it seems to me, is that the fellow in question
must have been an accomplice of Simpson’s.”</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“That’s the way it looks to me offhand,” he answered.
“I don’t pretend to be a detective, though.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I. Such problems interest me, though.
Can you tell me where the phone is?”</p>

<p>The doctor informed him, and Griswold left the
room in search of it. After a little more delay than
usual, owing to its being a suburban call, the millionaire
was connected with Nick Carter’s house in
New York. He was informed, however, that the detective
had left there shortly after seven o’clock the
evening before, and had not yet returned. Furthermore,
nothing had been heard from him.</p>

<p>This information was a great disappointment to
Griswold, for he had hoped to get in touch with Nick
at once.</p>

<p>“Very likely he has gone to Hattontown,” he decided.
“If both of them had been watching this place,
Cray would hardly have got the worst of it to such an
extent, and would certainly not have been left to be
found by accident—unless there’s a whole gang involved.
In that case, Carter himself must have met
with foul play. But it doesn’t seem likely that Simpson
could have enlisted any strong-arm assistance.”</p>

<p>He reëntered the room where Doctor Lord was.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll have a look around myself,” he announced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
“Will you tell me just where this man was
found?”</p>

<p>Three minutes later, he approached the pile of lumber,
having quietly left the house by the front door and
walked around by way of the graveled drive.</p>

<p>He was looking for signs of a struggle, but had
found none. The arrangement of the lumber had been
changed when the boards had been hastily thrown
from on top of Cray’s form, and the sod had been
badly trodden by the rescuers.</p>

<p>Having decided that he was not capable of reading
the signs there, if there were any to be read, the newspaper
proprietor stepped rather aimlessly toward the
little garage. Passing around it, he tried the door, and
found it locked. While he was tugging at it, however,
a sound came to his ears from within, and he paused
abruptly, holding his breath.</p>

<p>“What was that?” he thought.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.
<br />
<small>SIMPSON IS FOUND.</small></h2>


<p>The sound was a curious, muffled groan, and in a
moment it was repeated.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” the thought flashed through Griswold’s
mind. “What if Carter has been injured, too,
and locked in here?”</p>

<p>For perhaps half a minute the newspaper proprietor
hesitated, as any man might have done under the circumstances,
then he called out in a guarded tone:</p>

<p>“Is that you, Carter?”</p>

<p>There was no answer in words, but he heard another
groan—or, rather, a prolonged and incoherent sound,
which suggested a tongueless man’s efforts at speech.</p>

<p>“He’s probably injured or gagged,” Griswold concluded.
“I mustn’t waste any time.”</p>

<p>He pressed against the sliding door some distance
below the lock, and found that it gave quite a little.
That discovery encouraged him, and, running around
the garage, he approached the pile of lumber, and
snatched up one of the boards.</p>

<p>It was twenty feet or more in length, and about six
or eight inches in width.</p>

<p>Returning as rapidly as he could, he pressed the
door with his hand, and inserted one end of the board
in the opening thus made, after which he began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
pry at the door. The length of the board made it unwieldy
and inclined to bend, but Griswold soon remedied
that by pushing in several feet of the board, and
then deliberately breaking it off.</p>

<p>He thereupon threw the larger piece aside, and,
using the smaller, which was now wedged in the door,
he drew it out for some distance, and then repeated
his prying operations.</p>

<p>This new weapon was much more convenient and
less inclined to bend. In fact, it proved to be unexpectedly
sturdy, and, after repeated attempts, into
which he threw all his strength, the millionaire presently
succeeded in breaking the lock.</p>

<p>The door was then quickly pushed back, and Griswold
peered into the interior of the garage. The place
was comparatively dark at first, in comparison with
the bright sunlight outside, but a further shove at the
door let in more light, and revealed a figure propped
up against the lower wall. There was a gag in its
mouth, its hands were evidently tied behind its back,
its ankles were bound, and a closer scrutiny revealed
that, in addition, it was tied to the wall in some way
so that it could not budge from its place.</p>

<p>Almost immediately Griswold saw that it was not
Nick Carter—or, rather, the man whom he supposed
to be Nick Carter. As he strode forward, however,
with an exclamation of pity, he did not recognize the
unfortunate, the lower part of whose face was obscured
by the handkerchief which was used as a gag.</p>

<p>It was not until this was removed that recognition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
came, and when it did, Griswold started back in amazement.</p>

<p>“Simpson!” he cried. “What on earth are you doing
here?”</p>

<p>The man tried to speak, but seemed unable to articulate.
Probably his throat and tongue were too dry
from disuse, and very likely the tongue and lips were
swollen as well.</p>

<p>Griswold saw the difficulty, and did not repeat his
question just then. Instead, he proceeded rapidly
to cut the cords which bound Simpson to the wall, and
also to sever the bonds about the ankles.</p>

<p>The body sagged to one side from weakness, and
when the millionaire turned it over to get at the wrists,
he found them encircled by handcuffs, instead of ropes.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” he muttered. “This is certainly a
strange state of affairs.”</p>

<p>It looked as if Simpson had been caught by Cray—or
perhaps by Cray and Nick Carter together—and
that subsequently the detective had been set upon by
others. That would account for Cray’s condition, and
it might be that Nick had been carried off. Had the
prisoner been locked in the garage, however, before
that attack had taken place? If not, it seemed hard
to explain, unless the mysterious assailants had not
been accomplices of his at all, but had worked independently.</p>

<p>The newspaper proprietor propped Simpson up
again, none too gently.</p>

<p>“I can’t get these handcuffs off,” he said. “Speak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
man, as soon as you can, and tell me what happened?
Where’s the money?”</p>

<p>John Simpson looked about him as if he did not
quite understand. As a matter of fact, his experiences
had left his faculties more or less benumbed for the
time being.</p>

<p>Griswold had to repeat his question in a more
peremptory tone.</p>

<p>“The money is gone,” Simpson managed to say at
last, after several futile efforts and much moistening
of the lips. “I—I had it here.”</p>

<p>“Go on, go on!” Griswold urged, bending eagerly,
with clenched hands.</p>

<p>“I had come in the car to carry it away to—to a
new hiding place I had found,” the absconding treasurer
explained with difficulty. “It was all in the car—two
suit cases full of it—when a couple of fellows
pounced on me.”</p>

<p>“Two, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, one was rather tall and very broad and
powerful——”</p>

<p>“Cray!” put in Griswold.</p>

<p>“Yes, he told me that after I was handcuffed,”
Simpson agreed, “and he said the other man was Nick
Carter.”</p>

<p>“So Carter was here? I wonder what’s happened to
him? When did the others butt in, Simpson, and who
were they?”</p>

<p>The handcuffed man looked up at him in bewilderment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about any others,” he declared,
with evident sincerity.</p>

<p>“But there must have been others. Cray was found
outside here this morning, with his head nearly mashed
in. Didn’t you hear anything after they shut you up.
You didn’t go to sleep right away, did you, after that
sort of thing? Did you have any accomplice?”</p>

<p>The treasurer shook his head in a dazed sort of
way. “Nobody else had any hand in what I did, Mr.
Griswold,” he said. “As for falling asleep, I guess you
wouldn’t have done that very quickly if you had been
in my place. I did doze off after daylight, but that was
all.”</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that he was telling the
truth. “Probably you were in a deep, exhausted sleep
when they found Cray,” he said. “The yard seems
to have been full of people then.”</p>

<p>“I did hear a dog barking,” Simpson admitted
finally. “It partially aroused me, but I dropped off
again. Maybe that was the time.”</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t the slightest idea of what happened
after you were locked up here?” persisted Griswold.</p>

<p>“Why, I guess I could explain that,” the thief replied
slowly, as if he were just beginning to realize what it
all meant. “It must have been Nick Carter who——”</p>

<p>“Who did what?”</p>

<p>“Who put the other fellow out of business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br />
<small>SUSPICION FALLS ON NICK.</small></h2>


<p>“For the love of Heaven!” exclaimed Lane Griswold,
in a shocked voice. “You are crazy, Simpson,
or lying! Do you actually mean to charge Carter, who
is one of the greatest detectives we have in this country,
and a man who is absolutely above suspicion in
every way, with having turned on his friend and associate,
Cray, and then made off with the money?”</p>

<p>Simpson’s air was one of injury. “I’m not crazy,
and I’m not lying,” he answered. “I’m telling you,
or am ready to tell you, just what I know, and all I
know. You’ve got me where you want me. Is it
likely that I’d do anything to get in deeper than I am?”</p>

<p>“Then, tell me about it—everything.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t much, and I didn’t actually see anything.
I heard things, though—more than I was intended
to, I guess. They tied me up here, and then,
while Carter was looking at the money in the suit
cases which I had already got in the car, Cray dug
over there to make sure that there wasn’t any of it still
buried. When he got through, Carter called him to
come out, saying that he had something to tell him that
he didn’t want me to hear.”</p>

<p>“Where was Carter then?”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t in sight. He had stepped to the corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
out there, just back of where the car was. You can see
that he could not have been many feet from here, so
it was easy enough for me to hear things.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, Cray went out, leaving the door open behind
him. The next thing I knew, I heard a queer
sort of dull thud, and pricked up my ears. It sounded
as if somebody had been hit, perhaps with a fist, or,
more likely, with something else.</p>

<p>“Of course, I didn’t know then which man had
done it, but I suspected that Carter had, because he
had called Cray out. The blow must have given Cray
something to think about, for there was a pause before
I heard him say ‘Mr. Carter!’—just like that. He
said it as if his best friend had turned on him, and
he didn’t know what to make of it. I guess Carter
must have tried to hit him again right away, for they
had a little tussle. It did not amount to much, because,
as I figured it out, Cray must have got a pretty
nasty blow that first time, and there wasn’t very much
fight in him. He must have done something, however,
for the other fellow snarled, ‘Curse you; take that,
then!’ and rapped him again, as I could tell by the
sound. Still Cray was not down and out. They
clinched, apparently, and then Cray muttered something,
or whispered it in a hoarse sort of whisper. I
couldn’t hear all of it, but it was something about
‘green-eyed.’ That seemed to make Carter more furious
than ever, so far as I could tell. He cursed Cray
some more, and seemed to strike him again and again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
That was the end of it. Carter locked me in then,
and I think he dragged Cray around the garage before
he drove off.”</p>

<p>Lane Griswold had been listening with all his ears
throughout this recital, his face the picture of amazement
and incredulity. Incidentally, his keen eyes
seemed to search Simpson’s very soul.</p>

<p>The man was a thief, and might easily be a liar as
well. What possible motive could he have for lying,
however? The millionaire could think of only one,
and that seemed far-fetched. It was conceivable, of
course, that, despite all the probabilities, John Simpson
might have had one or more confederates who had
struck down Cray, and carried the loot off to some new
place of concealment. In that case, the treasurer’s
story might be made up out of whole cloth.</p>

<p>But after a brief mental consideration of this, the
millionaire rejected the theory. If Simpson had had
any one to help him, surely he would not have remained
tied up there in a locked garage to starve, or
be caught by those who were searching for him.</p>

<p>Even if he had actually been surprised and handcuffed
by Cray before the arrival of his friends, the
latter would not have left him there to such an uncertain
fate. After giving the detective his quietus,
they would have carried Simpson off with them, handcuffs
and all, and found a means of releasing him later
on.</p>

<p>No, the man must be telling the truth. He had suffered
great hardships, and he was face to face with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the employer he had defrauded. Surely, he was not
the sort of man to lie under such circumstances, especially
after having confessed to hiding the money under
the earthen floor of the garage.</p>

<p>But if he had told the truth, and had not misinterpreted
what he heard—which seemed unlikely—what
could it possibly mean, except that the sight of so
much gold had proved too much for the great detective,
and that he had turned criminal.</p>

<p>Griswold faced the possibility very reluctantly, but
he felt obliged to face it. In fact, the more he thought
about it, the more convinced he became that it was the
one and only solution.</p>

<p>As a newspaper proprietor, he knew a great deal
about the seamy side of life, and was the custodian
of many discreditable secrets which for one reason or
another had never been allowed to see the light of
print. He did not need any one to tell him that all is
not gold that glitters, or that a man is necessarily
straight in every respect because he has never been
found out in any wrongdoing, and has always enjoyed
the best of reputations.</p>

<p>As far as that went, this might not be Carter’s first
fall from grace. The detective was undoubtedly an
extraordinarily clever man, and was said to be wealthy.
Might it not be that he had contrived for years to deceive
his clients, and fatten his bank account at their
expense?</p>

<p>The thought made Griswold gasp, but at the same
time it caused his heart to race with excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>What a beat it would be if his papers could announce
exclusively that Nick Carter, one of America’s greatest
detectives, and the so-called “archenemy of criminals,”
was in reality a master criminal himself! It
would cause a sensation, the like of which had never
been known.</p>

<p>Of course, Griswold confided none of this to the
man before him. Instead, with the instinct of the reporter,
which had never deserted him since his early
days of struggle, he surprised Simpson with a question.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you make of it?” he asked.</p>

<p>The thieving treasurer’s mind had reverted to his
own troubles, and it was with some difficulty that he
pulled himself together sufficiently to answer.</p>

<p>“Why, I—I hardly know what to think, Mr. Griswold,”
he replied. “It’s pretty hard to reconcile that
sort of thing with what I’ve always heard and read
about Nick Carter, but I have to believe my own ears,
don’t I? The money seems to have looked good
to Carter, just as it did to me, but that wasn’t all of
it, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking about that whisper of the other fellow’s,”
Simpson explained. “I told you, remember,
that he said something about ‘green-eyed.’ We use
that expression in only one connection, don’t we, in
speaking of ‘green-eyed jealousy?’ Don’t that look as
if Cray was accusing Carter of turning on him because
he was jealous of him for some reason?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Griswold was impressed. “That sounds plausible
enough,” he admitted.</p>

<p>He was unconsciously allowing himself to be led still
further astray, and it began to look as if the outcome
might be decidedly unpleasant for the great detective,
for the owner of a chain of great newspapers is not an
accuser who can be ignored or despised.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br />
<small>GRISWOLD IN COMMAND.</small></h2>


<p>The millionaire remained lost in thought for a few
moments longer, then grasped Simpson firmly by the
arm.</p>

<p>“Come into the house,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“But—but these, sir!” his former subordinate stammered,
nodding over his shoulder, and moving his
hands so that the chain of the handcuffs rattled.</p>

<p>For the moment Griswold had forgotten his desire
for secrecy. To be sure, if he could expose Nick, he
would be willing to have all the facts come out, but he
knew that he would have to be very sure of himself
and his facts before publishing any such charge against
a man of the detective’s reputation; consequently, he
would have to delay, in the hope that Cray would be
able to tell his side of the story, and until then it
was desirable that no rumors should be set in motion.</p>

<p>Therefore, he slipped off his motor coat and threw
it like a cloak over Simpson’s bowed shoulders.</p>

<p>“Come!” he commanded again.</p>

<p>And with shuffling steps, his head down, John Simpson
accompanied him to the house, but went through
the kitchen, instead of going around to the front door.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” the maid cried, as she caught
sight of her employer. “Mr. Simpson! Is it really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
you? I must run and tell Mrs. Simpson right this
minute!”</p>

<p>“No, no, Mary!” the wretched man protested
weakly. “Not—not yet! I wish to surprise her.”</p>

<p>Griswold had not told Simpson that the injured detective
was in the house, but now he led the thieving
treasurer to the room in which Cray lay. He said
nothing about his object, because he wished to see if
Simpson would recognize the patient at once.</p>

<p>If he did so without hesitation, and spoke of him
as Cray, that would go far to indicate the truth of his
story, for if Cray had been struck down under other
circumstances, this unexpected sight of him might
well cause a momentary confusion.</p>

<p>The spectacle was, indeed, unlooked for, but though
surprised, Simpson did not appear to be in the least
embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the fellow who called himself Cray,”
he said, with a nod. “He was the one that jumped on
me first, and the other, Carter, gagged me. He certainly
seems to be in pretty bad shape.”</p>

<p>The doctor looked at him in the greatest surprise.
He had never met Simpson, for the latter had moved
to the hill very recently. He knew him by sight, however.</p>

<p>“You may or may not know that this is John Simpson
himself, Doctor Lord,” the newspaper proprietor
said bruskly. “I found him locked up in the garage
just now. I’ll make it worth your while, however,
to keep a discreet tongue in your head.”</p>

<p>The young physician’s shoulders went back proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“I accept remuneration for professional services
only, Mr. Griswold,” he said crisply. “I hope I can
be trusted not to blab anything I may learn while attending
a case.”</p>

<p>“I meant no offense, I assure you, doctor,” Griswold
hastened to say. “I merely——”</p>

<p>“Wished to remind me of something you should
have taken for granted,” the doctor cut in. “Please
say no more about it, though.”</p>

<p>Then Lane Griswold did another unexpected thing.
He held out his hand with an apologetic smile, and,
after a moment’s hesitation, Doctor Lord gripped
it firmly.</p>

<p>A moment later Griswold led Simpson into another
room and closed the door.</p>

<p>“Look here, Simpson,” he said, without preliminaries,
“I’ve been grievously disappointed in you, but
we’ll let that pass. I’m done with you, and your dismissal
is waiting for you at the office. I want to hear
no excuses. As for prosecution, however, you have
doubtless counted on immunity from that, and I regret
to say that you haven’t counted in vain—unless this
new complication makes it worth while to air the whole
thing for the sake of a supreme newspaper sensation.
For your wife’s sake, I’ll let you know about that as
soon as possible. Meanwhile, I shall see that you
are under observation all the time. You can’t get
away, for I may want you locked up. If I don’t,
you’ll soon be free to do what you please and go where
you please.”</p>

<p>“I—yes, sir,” was all Simpson was able to say, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he had to swallow more than once before he could
utter those words.</p>

<p>“Now you had better go to your wife.”</p>

<p>“But these handcuffs, sir!” Simpson again protested.</p>

<p>“You should have thought of the possibility of such
adornments before you made away with that fund,”
Griswold told him sternly. “Don’t imagine that your
wife doesn’t know what you have been up to, for she
does. Still, it isn’t her fault, and I would not like
to see her needlessly distressed. Perhaps there’s a key
to the handcuffs in Cray’s pockets.”</p>

<p>There was, and Simpson was freed from the humiliating
shackles before he went upstairs to face his wife.</p>

<p>Griswold watched his halting progress, then sought
the young doctor once more.</p>

<p>“It’s important that this man should be able to talk
as soon as possible—if he’s ever going to,” he said.
“If you desire to consult with any one, no matter what
his price, do so, and I’ll be responsible. You may also
look to me for your fee, and I wish you would get
the best of trained nurses you can procure—one whose
discretion you can rely upon. While you are with the
patient, listen carefully for anything he may say, and
make a note of it, whether it seems delirious or not.
Request the nurse to do the same, and see that I’m
notified by phone as soon as Cray is able to be questioned
for five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Griswold.”</p>

<p>“One thing more. If the patient should become
lucid at any time, and you or the nurse should have
reason to believe that he may lapse into this same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
condition in a few minutes, ask him just one question
and jot down his answer.”</p>

<p>“And that question?”</p>

<p>“Ask him who is responsible for his injuries—who
struck him down.”</p>

<p>Doctor Lord agreed to do so if the opportunity offered,
and, after coming to that understanding, the
millionaire reëntered his waiting car.</p>

<p>“New York,” he ordered, giving Nick Carter’s address.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.
<br />
<small>A TRAP IS SET FOR NICK.</small></h2>


<p>Lane Griswold had telephoned to the detective’s
house only once, and then had been told that the detective
had not returned since the previous evening. It
might be, however, that Nick was there by this time.</p>

<p>Nothing in Simpson’s story indicated that Nick had
met with any mishap, and it was improbable that a
man of his daring and resourcefulness would take
to his heels at once simply because he had become a
thief. It was much more probable that he would return
home and bluff it out to the end.</p>

<p>In that case, Griswold hoped to corner him, and,
under threat of country-wide exposure, force him to
confess—after which an exposure would be likely to
follow, anyway.</p>

<p>The millionaire’s face was flushed and determined
as he strode up the detective’s steps and pressed the
electric button in peremptory fashion.</p>

<p>Joseph, the butler, opened the door.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Carter in?” Griswold demanded.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” was the prompt reply. “I can’t say when
he’ll be back, either.”</p>

<p>“I telephoned from New Pelham a couple of hours
ago,” Griswold went on. “I was told then that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
had left the house last evening, and had not returned.
Is that correct?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know where he is?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He was going to New Pelham on the
seven-thirty train, however.”</p>

<p>“He was, eh? That’s significant.”</p>

<p>He had sized up the butler, and decided that he
was telling the truth. If necessary, he would try
diplomacy. If he could get hold of Nick’s assistants,
he told himself, he might obtain some valuable pointers.</p>

<p>To be sure, if the detective had been playing the
wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing part for any length of time,
it was quite conceivable that his assistants, or some of
them, at least, were as bad as he. If this were the first
offense, however, it might be possible to get one of his
staff to turn against him, and assist in his capture, in
the hope of stepping into his shoes.</p>

<p>“I’m Mr. Griswold, the owner of the <em>Chronicle and
Observer</em>,” he told the butler. “Perhaps you’ll remember
that I was here yesterday with Mr. Cray? I’m
very anxious to see Mr. Carter himself, but one of
his assistants might do.”</p>

<p>“None of them is here now, sir,” Joseph told him.
“They’re all away from the city for one reason or
another. Mr. Carter’s chief assistant, Mr. Chickering
Carter, left for the Adirondacks with him just
the other day, and stayed up there when he returned
unexpectedly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Carter’s leading assistant! He would be the best
one!” thought Griswold.</p>

<p>Aloud he asked for Chick’s address.</p>

<p>“Something has happened,” he explained. “Cray
has been rather badly injured, and I can’t seem to
locate Mr. Carter. Under the circumstances, I feel
compelled to telegraph for this young man you speak
of, or else to call in some outsider.”</p>

<p>In view of this explanation, it is not surprising that
the butler gave him the desired information, especially
as he and Mrs. Peters had been worrying somewhat
over Nick’s unexplained absence.</p>

<p>Armed with the address, Griswold lost little time
in reaching the nearest telegraph office, and in drafting
a message to Chick Carter. It read:</p>

<p>“Unusually important case on. Am badly injured.
Come at once.”</p>

<p>And it was signed “Cray.”</p>

<p>He had decided to send it in the injured detective’s
name, believing that it would have more force than
if dispatched by a third party. The absence of any
specific directions for finding Cray was intentional.
Griswold had neglected to make any inquiries concerning
the injured man’s relatives, and did not even know
where he lived. He had been to his office, that was
all, and he knew that to be a business building.</p>

<p>He did not care to give the New Pelham address,
because he hoped to have a very confidential interview
with Chick, and he did not care to have it take place
under Simpson’s roof; therefore, he had decided to say
nothing about it, and to meet Chick’s train—for he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
estimated the time required for the telegram to reach
its destination, and could easily look up the trains
when he reached his office.</p>

<p>It was then nearly one o’clock in the afternoon, and
Chick could not be expected before morning. Meanwhile,
Griswold hoped for a summons from New
Pelham, but none came.</p>

<p>Growing impatient, he telephoned late in the afternoon,
and was informed by the new nurse that there
had been no change in Cray’s condition, except one
for the worse. He had sunken into a deep stupor.</p>

<p>“Hang it all! I hope he isn’t going to die,” Griswold
muttered. “If he does, without recovering consciousness,
I may not be able to fasten this thing
on Carter, after all, for I’m certain Simpson’s testimony
would not have any great weight, unless corroborated.”</p>

<p>Later, the millionaire called up Cray’s office. He
did not believe the injured detective had any one to
keep the place open during his absence, but he wished
to make sure, if possible, whether a message had been
received from Chick Carter or not. As he had expected,
he found the place closed.</p>

<p>It then occurred to him to return to Nick’s house.
The detective might have put in an appearance; if not,
it was possible that Chick had sent a reply there, trusting
that it would reach Cray indirectly.</p>

<p>In this latter respect, his surmise was correct. Nick
had not returned, and Joseph’s worry had grown. On
the other hand, a telegram had arrived for Jack Cray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and Joseph was holding it; not knowing what else to
do with it.</p>

<p>Griswold promised to deliver it, and took it in
charge. In this way he learned that his guess as to
Chick’s train was correct. The young detective wired
that he would arrive in New York at eight-thirty the
following morning.</p>

<p>Nothing developed in the interval, and a few minutes
before eight-thirty the next morning, Griswold
took up his position at one of the gates leading to
the tracks in the great Forty-second Street terminal.</p>

<p>The train from the Adirondacks arrived at schedule
time, and began to disgorge, while the millionaire, who
had obtained a description of Chick from the butler,
narrowly scanned the faces of the passengers as they
hurried through the gate.</p>

<p>The newspaper proprietor did not have to wait long.
He soon caught a glimpse of an erect, keen-eyed, athletic
young man, striding down the platform, and
carrying a heavy suit case, as if it were a featherweight.</p>

<p>“That must be Chick Carter!” he told himself, with
a nod of satisfaction.</p>

<p>But the next moment he gave a gasp, and a look
of utmost bewilderment spread over his face.</p>

<p>He had caught sight of the man at Chick’s side, and
feature for feature it was the man whom Cray had
called into consultation—was, in other words, Nick
Carter himself!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br />
<small>AT CROSS PURPOSES.</small></h2>


<p>Staggered, his brain reeling under the shock, Lane
Griswold was flung clean off his balance.</p>

<p>What was Nick Carter doing here? Had he hidden
the money somewhere, and hurried northward to join
his assistant, as if nothing had happened?</p>

<p>That must be it, and yet it hardly seemed possible
that he could have made the journey in that time. He
would have had to leave New York in the dead of
night following the robbery, and if he had reached
the mountain resort in the far northern part of the
State before Chick’s departure, there could have been
no time to spare. In other words, he must have returned
at once with his assistant.</p>

<p>But what nerve to have returned at all, in the face
of such a message from the man who had been half
killed by him!</p>

<p>The detective could not know that the telegram had
not been written or dictated by his victim, and therefore,
must expect to have to face Cray.</p>

<p>It was incomprehensible, and yet there was Nick,
beyond a doubt, and more than that, he was looking
as fresh and buoyant as possible.</p>

<p>A policeman brushed past Griswold, and, with a
quick movement, the latter touched the officer on the
arm. He would have Nick arrested, and then——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir?” the bluecoat asked civilly.</p>

<p>“That man!” the millionaire answered hoarsely,
pointing toward the approaching detective. “I must
ask you to——”</p>

<p>Then something stopped him. He remembered that
he did not have enough evidence as yet, and that it
would be very unwise to press matters, unless he were
reasonably sure of proving his charges.</p>

<p>“I—I’m mistaken!” he added confusedly.</p>

<p>The policeman looked at him for a moment in disgust,
then turned away with a shrug of his shoulders,
muttering something under his breath.</p>

<p>Undecided, his thoughts in a turmoil, the newspaper
proprietor stood aside and allowed Chick and his companion
to pass him. They had gone hardly more than
ten paces, however, before he suddenly made up his
mind to follow and have it out with the detective at
once.</p>

<p>He feared that it was a very foolish thing to do,
under the circumstances, especially as Chick might be
in the secret as well; nevertheless, he counted on his
wealth and prominence to stay their hands, no matter
how hostile they might be.</p>

<p>Just how he meant to proceed, he did not have the
slightest idea as yet, but impulse flung him after the
pair, and he overtook them just as they were about to
step into a taxi.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter!” he said sharply.</p>

<p>Both men turned.</p>

<p>“That’s my name,” the older man replied, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the millionaire over coolly, as if he had never seen
him before in his life.</p>

<p>The scrutiny had not gone far, however, before a
look of recognition sprang into Nick’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he went on. “Mr. Griswold, is it not?”</p>

<p>“You ought to know,” was the significant reply. “I
called on you yesterday, in company with Cray, and it
was that which took you to New Pelham night before
last.”</p>

<p>Nick looked from the newspaper proprietor to his
assistant, and back to Griswold again.</p>

<p>“There seems to be a very strange misunderstanding
here, Mr. Griswold,” he said. “I have just returned
from the Adirondacks, where we were enjoying
a little vacation. Chick, here, received a telegram
from my old friend, Jack Cray, stating that the latter
had been seriously injured in connection with an important
case, and asking that Chick return to New
York at once. I did not understand why the wire
hadn’t been sent to me, but, of course, I decided to
accompany my assistant. If you know anything about
Cray’s condition, I wish you would tell me.”</p>

<p>The dignified, commanding Lane Griswold looked
at the detective in a half-dazed manner, and his lower
jaw showed a tendency to drop.</p>

<p>“You are the coolest proposition I ever expect to
see, Carter!” he said, with grudging admiration.</p>

<p>It was clear that something extraordinary was in
the air, and Nick acted accordingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know in the least what you are hinting
at, Mr. Griswold,” he said, “and this is hardly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
place for explanations. Will you do us the honor of
sharing our taxi with us? Perhaps we can come to
some understanding on the way home.”</p>

<p>Certainly, there did not seem to be anything menacing
in his attitude, and in that of the younger detective
at his side. Both appeared to be genuinely mystified.
Griswold attributed it to good acting, nothing
more, but after a few moments’ hesitation, he decided
to accept the offer.</p>

<p>They would hardly dare attack him in a cab in broad
daylight, and he need not enter the detective’s house,
if he did not choose to do so, when they reached their
destination. Accordingly, he bowed, and, in response
to Nick’s gesture, stepped into the taxi, after which
the others followed.</p>

<p>“Now, you’ll greatly oblige us, Mr. Griswold, by
explaining what you are driving at,” Nick said, with
courteous firmness.</p>

<p>The millionaire was a little too impetuous now and
then, and this was one of the occasions. His reason
told him that he had been misled in some unaccountable
way, and that this was the real Nick Carter, but
reason spoke in a very small whisper, and he did not
choose to listen—in fact, he hardly heard it.</p>

<p>He had kept his rage and sense of injury bottled
up, thus far, but now it exploded.</p>

<p>“I’m driving at just this, Carter,” he said hotly.
“You are found out—the game is up! I don’t know
whether this is the first time temptation has been too
much for you, or not, but I have you where I want
you, you thief! Your spectacular career is at an end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
My papers have a circulation well into the millions, you
know, and as soon as I say the word, the greatest
broadside of publicity that was ever fired will be hurled
at your crime of the night before last! Oh, you need
not glower at me! I’m not in the least afraid of you,
and what I say, I mean, as you will learn to your
cost.”</p>

<p>Any one who knew Nick Carter well would have
seen that he was growing dangerously warm, but the
increasing tension was much more noticeable in Chick.</p>

<p>That young man wore his “fighting face,” and was
bending forward longingly, with twitching hands on
his knees.</p>

<p>Nick, seeing his assistant’s attitude and look, laid a
restraining hand on Chick’s arm.</p>

<p>“Easy there, my boy!” he murmured, then turned
again to Griswold.</p>

<p>“I fear you are a little hasty, and will soon regret
it, Mr. Griswold,” he said as quietly as he could. “If
I were not sure of your identity, and inclined to believe
that you are laboring under a very serious misapprehension,
I should not be so patient. I have been
in the Adirondacks for several days, and know nothing
whatever of the circumstances to which you
allude.”</p>

<p>“You lie!” replied the millionaire, his face purple.
“You went to the Adirondacks several days ago with
your assistant, but you came back alone. I have your
own butler’s word for that. What’s more, I saw you
with my own eyes yesterday at your home, whither
Cray took me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Again Nick and his lieutenant exchanged glances.
It was beginning to look more and more serious. Had
Nick not recognized the newspaper proprietor at once,
they might have supposed the man to be irresponsible,
despite his references to Cray, but that explanation
seemed out of the question in Griswold’s case.</p>

<p>Yet, the alternative appeared to be just as far beyond
belief.</p>

<p>Had some one passed himself off as the detective
under any ordinary circumstances, it would have been
easy enough to believe, for such things had happened
often enough in the past. The millionaire’s statements,
however, seemed to imply that some person had
been passing as the detective in his own house, and
had done so in such a skillful and thoroughgoing way
that not only the servants, but even Jack Cray, had
been completely deceived.</p>

<p>It was unbelievable, and yet what else were they to
think?</p>

<p>Chick had often seen the skin over his chief’s jaw
and knuckles tighten ominously, but he never remembered
such a set, tense look as this one.</p>

<p>Nick was beginning to realize that something unparalleled
had happened—something which struck directly
at his honor and prestige—and he was rising to
the emergency.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.
<br />
<small>GRISWOLD STILL DOUBTFUL.</small></h2>


<p>The detective leaned forward in the taxi, and held
Griswold’s eyes commandingly.</p>

<p>“That’s about enough of that, Griswold,” he said,
with ominous quiet. “I would advise you to restrain
yourself. I’m not accustomed to being approached in
this way, and I’ve endured it thus far only because
I’ve made allowance for your obvious excitement. I
supposed that a man in your position would be sufficiently
informed concerning me and my work to have
no such illusions, and sufficiently in command of himself
to conquer such heated impulse. A moment’s reflection
ought to convince you that my presence up the
State for the last few days can easily be verified.</p>

<p>“And now, if you’ll come to your senses, I shall be
more than eager to hear what you have to say about
this extraordinary experience of yours. First, though,
tell me how seriously my friend is injured.”</p>

<p>During this speech, and for some moments afterward,
the millionaire newspaper man continued to
gaze at the detective as if he were trying to pierce his
very soul, and when he withdrew his gaze at length,
it was only to shift it to Chick.</p>

<p>“You almost persuade me,” he told Nick at last.
“Either I’ve been dreaming, though, or I’m dreaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
now. This is the most amazing thing that has ever
occurred in my experience. I want to believe in you,
Carter, I assure you. I have all along, and it was only
with the greatest reluctance that I accepted the conclusion
which seemed forced upon me by circumstances
which I could not question.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and then launched into an
account of his reasons for visiting Cray, the latter’s
suggestion that they should call upon Nick Carter and
seek his aid, the interview in the detective’s study, and
so on.</p>

<p>“I can’t see any difference,” he declared. “So far
as I can tell, you are the same man I talked with there,
and don’t forget that Cray himself was evidently convinced
that he was talking with you. Later, you—or
the man I took to be you—phoned me and asked
further particulars concerning Simpson. I hoped for
speedy results, of course, with the case in such hands,
but I heard nothing more until the next morning, when
I was informed that a man named Jones, who had represented
himself as connected with the <em>Chronicle and
Observer</em> office, had been seriously injured in New Pelham.
The description suggested Cray, and I hastened
up into Westchester County. I found that it was Cray,
and learned that he had been muttering your name.
He had been repeatedly struck on the head with some
blunt instrument, and the doctor feared a fracture.
He had not really been conscious, though, and hasn’t
been yet, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>“I questioned Mrs. Simpson and the doctor, and
learned that Cray had been found in the back yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
near one of those little portable garages. Curiosity
sent me out there, and, hearing a sort of groan, I broke
into the garage, and, to my amazement, found Simpson
himself bound and gagged.”</p>

<p>He then went on to repeat the treasurer’s story of
his capture, and the unseen conflict that had taken
place between Cray and his companion—the man
whom Jack had referred to as Nick Carter.</p>

<p>Incidentally, he referred to the term “green-eyed,”
which Simpson had overheard.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s pretty strong circumstantial evidence,
isn’t it?” he demanded at the conclusion. “If you
are really Nick Carter, and can prove that you haven’t
been in New York for days, no one will rejoice more
sincerely than I—although it would cheat me out of
a tremendous news sensation. Frankly, though, I still
find it almost impossible to believe you, despite your
attitude and your appearance of sincerity. How could
your own servants have been deceived? How could
any one have lived in your house for days without betraying
himself in some way? How could Cray, a detective
himself, and an old friend, have been so blind?”</p>

<p>Nick and his assistant had listened to the story
with growing interest and excitement. More than
once they had exchanged meaning glances, but when
Griswold mentioned the compound word which had
been part of Cray’s last startled whisper, the faces
they turned to each other were a study.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible for them to keep silence any
longer, but they managed to do so until the millionaire
had finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“The ‘dead’ have come to life more than once, you
know, in our experience,” Nick said softly, looking
at his assistant.</p>

<p>Chick nodded. “Yes, that must be it, I suppose,”
he agreed. “I was thinking all along that I knew
of no one else who would possibly have turned such
a trick, and when it came to that ‘green-eyed’ business——”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t much room left for doubt,” Nick
supplied.</p>

<p>“What in thunder are you two talking about?” Griswold
broke in.</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard of Ernest Gordon, familiarly
known as Green-eye Gordon?” the detective asked him.</p>

<p>“Of course. I read my newspapers more carefully
than any one else does. Good heavens! Is it possible
that you think Gordon could have impersonated you?”</p>

<p>Nick nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s precisely what I feel obliged to think,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“But—but Gordon is in prison, isn’t he? No, by
Heaven, he’s dead! I had forgotten for the moment,
but he died in that fire up at Dannemora a short time
ago. Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“That was the report,” Nick admitted readily, “and
naturally I accepted it at the time, as every one else
did. This astounding information you have just given
me, however, puts a very different face on the matter.
I believe Gordon would have been capable of that sort
of thing—in fact, I have evidence of similar stunts
pulled off by him in the past. Furthermore, I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of no one else with a criminal record who would have
been capable of such a performance—and no one
without a long criminal experience would have dared
do such a thing. Finally, we have Simpson’s testimony,
which seems plain enough to me. When Cray
was first attacked, he naturally assumed that his assailant
was I, and he spoke my name in dazed incredulity.
The next moment, however, overwhelming doubt
would naturally have assailed him, and, under the influence
of that, he must have obtained a closer glimpse
in some way. Or it may be that the scoundrel betrayed
himself unconsciously. Jack was about all in by that
time, but he had strength enough to whisper his enemy’s
name. He wasn’t talking about green-eyed jealousy,
you may be sure, but about Green-eye Gordon!”</p>

<p>“Very ingenious,” Griswold admitted doubtfully.</p>

<p>“How could such a mistake have been made at the
prison, however? The report of Gordon’s death has
never been corrected.”</p>

<p>“Probably because its inaccuracy has never been
discovered,” Nick told him. “A convict was burned
unrecognizably, and the remains were identified only
by the number on the coat. Another convict escaped
and hasn’t been recaptured. Isn’t it easy enough to
believe that a man of Gordon’s stamp might have seen
a fellow prisoner succumb to the choking fumes, and,
under cover of the excitement, might have managed
to exchange coats without being discovered?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.
<br />
<small>NICK DISCOVERS HIS LOSS.</small></h2>


<p>“By George!” ejaculated Lane Griswold.</p>

<p>He was beginning to see light.</p>

<p>“Is this Gordon of the same height and build as
yourself?” he asked eagerly a moment later.</p>

<p>“Quite near enough for the purpose, as I recall,”
Nick replied. “More than that, he’s a master of make-up,
and would have had very little trouble in copying
my features. His eyes are light, nondescript, to be
sure, but——”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see how it would have been possible
for him to have fooled everybody in that fashion,”
the millionaire objected.</p>

<p>“The human eye is far from perfect, Mr. Griswold,”
Nick reminded him. “Besides, we have to allow
always for the action of the mind behind it—that
mind which interprets everything it sees. In short,
we generally see what we expect to see. Such a successful
masquerade appears little short of miraculous
to one who isn’t a special student of such things, but
it’s far from an impossibility. My butler and housekeeper,
and Cray himself, had no reason to suppose
that it was not I they were seeing; therefore, as I
had been a familiar sight to them for years, they
would never have thought of examining the masquerader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
They merely gave him fleeting glances, and
as those glances did not detect any glaring defect, that
was all there was to it.”</p>

<p>Nick paused and smiled.</p>

<p>“Well, are you as sure as ever that I’m a rascal?”
he asked.</p>

<p>The newspaper proprietor held out his hand with an
embarrassed air.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ll never forgive me, Mr. Carter,
for making such an accusation,” he said apologetically.
“You may be sure I shall never forgive myself. I
ought to have known better, of course, and I’m very
much ashamed that I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Say no more, please!” the detective cried heartily,
grasping the millionaire’s hand and giving it a good
shake. “I don’t blame you—I can’t. There didn’t
seem to be any other way out. Here we are, though,
at the house. Will you come in, Mr. Griswold?
Then, a little later, we can go up to New Pelham together,
if you wish, and see if poor Cray is any better?
Naturally, I’m anxious to get his side of the
story, in order to make sure that he really did identify
Green Eye.”</p>

<p>“That program suits me,” Griswold responded.
“Naturally, if a man of Gordon’s stamp has got hold
of the fund, the chances of recovering the money are
slimmer than ever, and if you are willing to undertake
the case, there’s no time to be lost.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I shall undertake it,” Nick assured him.
“You could not drive me off with an ax. My honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and reputation are involved, and, under the circumstances,
I shall refuse to accept a fee.</p>

<p>“No, that’s final,” he insisted, in response to Griswold’s
objections. “I trust, however, that you will
fully recompense Cray, no matter whether he does
anything more or not. He has earned it.”</p>

<p>They had reached the detective’s study by that time,
and Nick and his lieutenant were gazing about curiously.
In a moment the former stepped forward and
snatched up a pair of gloves that lay on the desk.</p>

<p>“Look here, Chick!” he cried. “These are from my
room up in Harlem. I see I shall have to move it. I
didn’t dream that any one had discovered it, but Gordon
must have done so, it appears, before he was sent
up.”</p>

<p>Chick, meanwhile, had approached the safe, and was
just about to examine it, when his chief called his attention
to the gloves. Now he returned and pushed
away the chair that Green Eye had placed in front
of it.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, chief!” he ejaculated a moment
later. “He’s broken into your safe!”</p>

<p>Nick reached the spot in one bound, and, after glancing
at the makeshift which Green Eye had employed
to hide his handiwork, he pulled the great door open,
and, bending, pressed the spring that operated the
inner one.</p>

<p>The latter in turn clicked open, was seized, and
drawn back.</p>

<p>A momentary glance revealed several empty pigeonholes,
and a confused mass of papers in others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Merciful Heaven!” exclaimed Nick, clenching his
fists and raising them aloft, while his face became as
white as a sheet. “The fiend has taken what he wanted
here! I wouldn’t have had this happen for anything
in the world. It means—Heaven knows what it
doesn’t mean!”</p>

<p>His assistant realized only too well what the catastrophe
foreshadowed, but, for the time being, he was
stricken dumb. He could only look from Nick’s
shocked face to the gaping safe.</p>

<p>But, of course, Griswold did not fully comprehend,
and managed to put his foot in it again.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad that you have lost any valuable papers,”
he said. “I have lost eighty thousand dollars,
though, and the sooner you get on the trail of the fellow,
the better.”</p>

<p>Nick turned on him with a look of scorn. “What
do I care about your infernal eighty thousand dollars!”
he demanded fiercely, his patience exhausted at
last. “It doesn’t amount to a row of pins—or
oughtn’t to, at any rate. The papers in this safe, though—the
most valuable of which have doubtless been
stolen—involve the honor and peace of mind of scores
of men and women who are prominent in all walks of
life. Don’t you understand, man? They are my private
and most confidential records, covering the most
important cases of years—records which would mean
hundreds of thousands of dollars to the blackmailer.
And that isn’t all, for if used in that way, as this fellow
doubtless intends to use them, and will, if he
isn’t prevented at once, they will bring anguish to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
great many people. Finally, the fact that they have
fallen into unscrupulous hands will work me more
harm than anything else could possibly do.”</p>

<p>His anger against Griswold had cooled while he
was speaking, however.</p>

<p>“But, fortunately,” he went on in a calmer tone.
“We have every reason to believe that your gold is
in the same hands as my papers; therefore, the trail
isn’t likely to fork.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” Griswold agreed eagerly. “I beg your
pardon again, Carter. I didn’t realize what this loss
meant to you and others. It gives you a supreme incentive,
however, to go after the fellow.”</p>

<p>Before he could add more, the desk phone rang, and
Chick answered it.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is Mr. Carter’s house,” the young detective
said. “You are speaking from Mr. Griswold’s
office? Yes, Mr. Griswold is here. Do you wish to
speak to him?... All right, I understand. I’ll
tell him at once. Good-by.”</p>

<p>The receiver clicked back into its place, and Chick
turned to the expectant listeners.</p>

<p>“They say that the doctor has phoned from Simpson’s
house, at New Pelham, Mr. Griswold,” he said.
“Cray is conscious at last.”</p>

<p>“Good!” ejaculated Nick. “You and I will go there
at once, Chick. How about you, Mr. Griswold? Will
you come along?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” was the prompt answer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.
<br />
<small>CRAY’S LIPS ARE UNSEALED.</small></h2>


<p>Despite his eagerness to see his friend Cray, and
to get on the fugitive’s trail, Nick remained at the
house long enough to draft a telegram to the warden
of Clinton Prison, asking for further details concerning
the supposed death of Green-eye Gordon, and the
escape of one of the prisoners on the night of the fire.</p>

<p>The message was given to the butler, who was
asked to phone it at once to the telegraph office.</p>

<p>“They may have facts up there which they have been
keeping from the public,” Nick explained. “Even
seemingly valueless facts may assume great importance
in the light of what has happened down here,
for that matter.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one of Nick’s fastest cars had been ordered
around, and now the familiar honk-honk was
heard.</p>

<p>“There’s the machine,” Nick announced. “Come
on.”</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen that both Nick and his assistant
were laboring under unusual excitement. The
chauffeur was instructed to push the car to the lawful
limit, and although he did so, with his usual skill, the
detective seemed to think the car was creeping.</p>

<p>For miles and miles they had to traverse the streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of the city which stretched out northward to the confines
of the Bronx, and not until these were passed,
did they feel free to risk a faster pace—and even then
they had to slow down through the frequent villages.</p>

<p>It was not in reality a long drive, however, and in
less time than Griswold had made the trip the morning
before, they had covered the distance.</p>

<p>The chauffeur had slowed down considerably before
entering the village of New Pelham, but they were
still going at a rapid rate, and Griswold was obliged
to raise his voice for his final instructions to the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>“The top of the hill!” he called out, leaning forward
and pointing, while he held his hat on with the
other hand.</p>

<p>The usually easy-going millionaire was having some
unusual experiences, and had been pretty thoroughly
shaken up in more ways than one.</p>

<p>Straight up the hill that led from the heart of the
village, the great car raced, and Griswold added that
it was the last house. A few moments later the machine
came to an abrupt, but quiet, stop in front of No. 31
Floral Avenue.</p>

<p>Quickly the three men alighted and hurried through
the gate. The door was opened almost immediately
by the maid, and behind her stood Doctor Lord, who
had evidently been impatiently awaiting Griswold’s
arrival.</p>

<p>The doctor looked inquiringly at the others.</p>

<p>“Carter, shake hands with Doctor Lord,” he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
informally. “Doctor, this is Nick Carter and this is
Chick Carter, his assistant.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad,” the young physician said heartily,
as he acknowledged the detective’s greeting. “Frequently
during the patient’s long stupor, Mr. Carter,
he mumbled your name.”</p>

<p>“Just how is he?” Nick asked eagerly, and, for the
moment, concern for his friend weighed with him
more than anything else.</p>

<p>“He’s better,” was the reply. “He has taken the
turn that I hoped for, and now, although he may be
laid up for some time, I think I may safely say that
the danger is over. You must not see him for long,
however, and you had better come at once. I’ve been
afraid that he might lapse into unconsciousness again
before Mr. Griswold could get here.”</p>

<p>“You have questioned him as I suggested?” the
millionaire put in, as they moved toward the door of
the room in which Cray was lying.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer, “but he’s stubborn. He
refuses to tell me anything—said he would do so if
he felt himself losing consciousness again, but that
he wanted to say what he had to say directly to Mr.
Griswold, if possible.”</p>

<p>They had reached the door of the room by that
time, and Lord stepped aside to allow the others to
enter.</p>

<p>A nurse in a trim, crisp uniform was sitting beside
the couch, but rose and effaced herself quietly, thus
giving Nick his first unobstructed view of his friend.</p>

<p>The burly detective seemed to fill the narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
couch, and yet he appeared, somehow, shrunken. His
face was still very pale, and the big, hairy hand that
lay on his chest had a suggestion of helplessness
about it.</p>

<p>Cray turned his head slowly, and looked toward
the door. Instead of seeing merely the millionaire, as
he had anticipated, he beheld two other visitors, and
identified them after a moment or two.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter!” he exclaimed weakly. “And Chick,
too! Is it really you this time, Carter? This is more
than I hoped for.”</p>

<p>He tried to raise himself on one elbow, but sank
back faintly.</p>

<p>“Lie still, old fellow!” Nick said, quietly stepping
forward and taking Cray’s hand. “You are gaining,
and must hold on to what you have gained. Take your
time, though, about——”</p>

<p>“I can’t take my time, Carter,” Cray said, feverishly
clutching at his friend’s hand with both of his. “This
isn’t the worst yet. It was Gordon—Green-eye Gordon—who
did this to me, and he’s made off with two suit
cases crammed full of gold coins.”</p>

<p>Nick saw that it would be necessary to cut the
interview short, but he wished to test Cray, if possible.
It might be that Jack had forgotten about the fire and
the reports of Gordon’s death. If he were reminded
of that, he might not be so sure about the identity of
his assailant.</p>

<p>“But Gordon is dead, you know—burned to death
in prison,” Nick said quietly.</p>

<p>“No, no! Don’t you believe it, Carter!” the patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
insisted. “There’s no mistake about it. I forgot about
all those reports when he struck me; they don’t cut
any ice. I have thought about them since I woke up,
and I’m just as sure as ever that it was Gordon.”</p>

<p>“What makes you so sure?” inquired Nick.</p>

<p>“He forgot himself when he cursed me,” was the
reply, “and I thought I recognized the voice; then I
caught a glimpse of his eyes, and I was sure. There’s
only one man with eyes like that—cat’s eyes. They
looked green as he glared at me. He knows I recognized
him, because I said his name just before I got
my knock-out. Probably he thought he had killed me,
for I don’t believe he would have left me to tell the
tale.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and one hand wandered
weakly to his injured head.</p>

<p>“I’ll never get over the way I was taken in,” he
went on, more faintly. “Most humiliating. Must say,
he’s a wonder, though. Never imagined anybody could
pull off a stunt like that. The car is an electric—a
coupé, two or three years old, I should say. The gold
was in a couple of suit cases which had been buried
in the ground. Can’t tell you any more, I’m afraid—just
about all in, you see.”</p>

<p>He looked about helplessly, and in a frightened
sort of way, then, with a sigh, lapsed into unconsciousness
once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.
<br />
<small>NICK OUTLINES HIS CAMPAIGN.</small></h2>


<p>In a moment Doctor Lord and the nurse were back
at the patient’s side.</p>

<p>“I must ask you gentlemen to go,” the physician
said crisply. “This has been too much for him, as it
is, and any further excitement might cause serious
complications, if nothing worse.”</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to withdraw, and to
hope that the effect of the interview would not be as
serious as the doctor suggested.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the detective instinct had been strong
in Cray, notwithstanding his condition, and he had
covered the ground pretty thoroughly—surprisingly
so, in view of the few words he had spoken. His statement
about the suit case, and his description of the car
might prove particularly valuable.</p>

<p>Nick took pains to interview Simpson, his wife,
and the servant before leaving the house and then paid
a visit to the garage.</p>

<p>He smiled as he noted the subterfuge of the underground
gasoline tank.</p>

<p>“Quite clever, on the surface,” he remarked, “but
Simpson seems to be a queer mixture. He impresses
you at one time with his cleverness, at another with
stupidity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t see anything stupid about this,” Griswold
objected. “It strikes me as very ingenious. It permitted
him to dig up the ground to his heart’s content
without arousing suspicion.”</p>

<p>“True,” conceded the detective. “The ordinary person
would have seen nothing strange about it; but
doesn’t the presence of a gasoline tank underground,
or any other kind, strike you as a little peculiar when
a man owns an electric?”</p>

<p>The millionaire looked very sheepish. “I’m afraid
I must plead guilty to stupidity as well,” he confessed.
“That didn’t occur to me, and I doubt if it ever
would.”</p>

<p>The two detectives made a thorough examination
of the little garage, the ground about it, and the pile
of lumber, as well as the road at the rear.</p>

<p>They found some finger prints, and photographed
them carefully, after bringing out other details by
artificial means. They were inclined to believe that
some of them belonged to Gordon, and if so, their
discovery would prove valuable. Beyond that, however,
they learned little.</p>

<p>“Well, we had better part company here, Chick,”
Nick told his assistant. “I’m going to let you pick up
the trail of the electric car and follow it, if you can.
See if you can locate the machine. Probably it has
been abandoned long before this, for it would have to
be recharged before it could go very far. Doubtless,
Green Eye remembered that, and deserted it before
such attention was necessary. Still, if you can find
where he dispensed with it, you can get a clew to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
subsequent movements, especially as he was burdened
with a couple of very heavy suit cases.”</p>

<p>“Consider me on the job,” was Chick’s ready
reply. “I’ll start work right away, and keep going as
long as the going is good. How about you, though?
What are you going to tackle?”</p>

<p>“I shall return home at once,” Nick replied, “and
go through the safe. I must find out which records are
missing, and when I have learned that, I ought to be
able to catch the rascal sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“You mean that he’ll be sure to visit some of the
people interested, or write to them, and that you can
nab him in that way?” his assistant asked.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea. If Green Eye hasn’t learned of
our return—and I sincerely hope he hasn’t—he won’t
lose much time in getting to work at the blackmailing
business, and you may be sure he’ll choose some of the
most tempting of the local people for his first victims.”</p>

<p>Chick held up his hand. “I get you,” he said. “That’s
just what will happen, unless he’s scared off, and he’ll
work quickly, for fear you may return earlier than
you had expected, and get wind of the whole thing.
Alongside of that, my job seems pretty punk, but
you’re the general.”</p>

<p>“Your job is a necessary one, and we may need all
the dope on Green Eye’s movements that we can get,”
Nick told him.</p>

<p>Very shortly afterward they separated, Chick remaining
behind, while Nick and the millionaire reëntered
the car and started back to the city.</p>

<p>Very little was said on the journey. To be sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Griswold seemed willing enough to keep the conversational
ball rolling, but he soon found that Nick was
of a different mind. He was glad, therefore, when the
detective’s house was reached, and Nick stepped out
of the machine, after instructing the chauffeur to take
Griswold wherever he wished to go.</p>

<p>“You think you can catch him, then?” the millionaire
asked in parting.</p>

<p>Nick gave him a strange look. “If I fail in this,
I’ll shut up shop,” he replied.</p>

<p>It was said rather lightly, but Griswold was a
shrewd student of character, and knew that famous
Nemesis of criminals was in deadly earnest.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.
<br />
<small>WAITING FOR A NIBBLE.</small></h2>


<p>Nick Carter hardly knew what to do about the members
of his household. They had not yet been informed
of the way in which they had been taken in, and it
was difficult to decide whether they should be or not.
After some reflection, however, the detective decided
to say nothing about it, for the present.</p>

<p>They accepted his presence as a matter of course,
just as they had done in the case of the impostor, and
if he told them the truth, they would be plunged into
a state bordering on panic.</p>

<p>Moreover, if Gordon should take a notion to return
to the house, after such a revelation, it would be almost
impossible for the butler, housekeeper, and the
rest to be their natural selves in his presence. If they
betrayed their knowledge, they might scare him off
just when Nick wished him to be most at his ease.</p>

<p>Nick entered his study, and, after walking up and
down for a few minutes, seated himself in his desk
chair.</p>

<p>There was a tenseness about his look and every
movement he made. He was like a perfectly trained
athlete, crouched for a start of some record-breaking
dash.</p>

<p>The famous detective was well acquainted with danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and to risk his life was an easy matter of everyday
occurrence. He took up the most serious and dangerous
cases without a thought of the possible consequences
to himself. Here, however, was something
different.</p>

<p>This came nearer home, perhaps, than anything
else had ever done, for, through him the honor and
peace of mind of numbers of persons—conspicuous
targets, all of them—were threatened.</p>

<p>Too late the detective recognized that his reputation
was not enough to protect his house and his private
safe from violence, and that he had no right to keep
such records there. They should all be in a safe-deposit
vault.</p>

<p>The reports of his ordinary cases might continue
to be kept in his steel filing cabinets, where they were
available for ready reference, but those concerning
persons of wealth and position—men and women who
were tempting prey, and whose secrets, if revealed in
the newspapers, would cause a widespread sensation—must
be better protected in future.</p>

<p>That, however, would not help the present situation
which Nick was now forced to face.</p>

<p>He actually shrank from going over the disarranged
papers which Green Eye had left behind, but
after a little delay he forced himself to open the safe,
empty the remaining pigeonholes, et cetera, and dump
their contents on the desk. That done, he sat himself
down and went to work.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there was a comparatively small number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of papers of that description in the safe, therefore
it did not take very long to go through them and
check off those which remained—for the methodical
detective had a list of all of them.</p>

<p>In this way, by a process of elimination, Nick quickly
learned the ones which had been stolen, and his expression
grew grimmer than ever as he realized the
shrewdness of Gordon’s choice.</p>

<p>Most of the missing papers concerned individuals
or families in and around New York, which seemed
to imply that a quick clean-up was contemplated. Some
few, though, involved persons farther away, and these
appeared to have been selected because they had offered
particularly tempting bait to the blackmailer.</p>

<p>It needed only the brief entries in the index to bring
back to Nick’s mind all of the important details of
each case, and he ground his teeth as he pictured the
scoundrel gloating over those same details, and cleverly
scheming to demand the top price for their suppression.</p>

<p>“What a haul!” he murmured aloud. “All those
papers, and seventy-five or eighty thousand in gold,
to boot! If it’s really Ernest Gordon with whom we
have to deal—and I’m morally certain it is—he must
be drunk with joy, for he has made blackmailing an
art, and he could not ask anything bigger or more
promising of that sort. In his calmer moments,
though, he must realize that he won’t have the chance
to hold up many of these people.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he know that the first man he approaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
will in all probability come running to me to demand
an explanation, if nothing more? And hasn’t it occurred
to him that I would receive an urgent summons
home under such circumstances? Well, if it has, he’ll
see all the more reason for striking while the iron is
hot.”</p>

<p>He had put the papers away temporarily, intending
to find a safer place for them at the earliest opportunity,
when the butler entered the study with a telegram.
It proved to be from the warden at Clinton
prison, and was a long one—sent “collect,” of course.</p>

<p>It contained certain new and significant, though
minor, details concerning the supposed death of Green-eye
Gordon, and the escape of the yegg from Buffalo,
which served to confirm Nick’s suspicions, but
the most striking thing about the message was the
tone of it. It gave the impression that the warden
had been doubtful, or was doubtful now concerning
the identity of the man who had been burned. He did
not say so, of course, but Nick could read doubt between
the lines.</p>

<p>Obviously, the identification had been a very careless
one, or else the prison authorities had deliberately
winked at the misleading statement which had found
their way into the newspapers. Very likely they took
it for granted at first that the partially burned body
was that of Gordon, and afterward preferred to hush
the thing up rather than let it be known that there was
any reason to believe that the redoubtable Green Eye
had escaped.</p>

<p>“Well, that settles it, I think, for all practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
purposes,” the detective told himself. “Cray’s identification
was a very hasty one, made under very unfavorable
circumstances, but when it’s taken in connection
with this transparent telegram, and especially in
connection with the nature, daring, and adroitness of
the crime itself, it seems safe enough to conclude that
Ernest Gordon is the man I must look for—and find.”</p>

<p>Which would be the best course, though? To warn
those who might be expected to be approached by the
criminal, or to wait until they came to the detective?</p>

<p>After some thought, Nick decided on the latter
course. Naturally, he did not wish that every one
concerned should know what had happened, for that
seemed unnecessary. He believed that Gordon would
concentrate on a few intended victims at first, and if
the detective could discover who those persons were,
he ought to be able to trap the rascal without allowing
the others to know what had threatened them.</p>

<p>It was his confident belief that practically every
one who might be visited or written to by the blackmailer
would try to get in touch with him—Nick
Carter—at once. That made him willing to play this
waiting game—at least, for a time.</p>

<p>“The first one who communicates with me,” he
thought, “should give me a line on the fellow’s methods
and plans. No one is likely to yield to his demands
on the spot, and if I can learn of a proposed
rendezvous or two, the rest should be fairly plain
sailing—unless the scoundrel learns of my return and
plays dead for a while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>He had reached this point in his musings when he
heard a furious ring at the doorbell.</p>

<p>“Possibly that’s the first of the victims now,” he
thought. “If it is, I must prepare myself for some
more or less well-grounded reproaches. I can stand
them, though, if in addition I’m put on the track of
the man I want to lay my hands on more than I ever
wanted to lay them on any one else.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII.
<br />
<small>THE FIRST VICTIM.</small></h2>


<p>Shortly afterward the butler knocked at the study
door and opened it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chester J. Gillespie to see you, sir,” he announced.</p>

<p>Before Nick could reply, or the butler could get out
of the way, for that matter, the young man named
pushed into the room, his face pale with agitation.</p>

<p>“You must help me, Mr. Carter!” he cried excitedly.
“I——”</p>

<p>He paused as Nick motioned the butler to withdraw
and close the door. When the servant had complied,
Nick said quietly:</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mr. Gillespie. I’m very sorry to learn
that some one has attempted to blackmail you, but
there’s no necessity for such great haste.”</p>

<p>His caller had started to take a chair, but paused
with his hand on the back of it, and stared at Nick
in the greatest amazement. Presently, a spot of angry
red appeared in each pale cheek, and his rather
weak jaw thrust out aggressively.</p>

<p>“By Heaven!” he breathed. “I believe you are in
league with the fellow. I’ll swear I do! How otherwise
could you know that——”</p>

<p>“That will be about enough of that, Gillespie!” the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
detective said sternly. He had heard too many such
accusations in the last few hours. “If you have come
to me for help, as your rather abrupt opening words
would seem to indicate, let me warn you that you
are not furthering your case by insulting me.”</p>

<p>“I—I beg your pardon, Mr. Carter,” the bewildered
young man stammered. “I didn’t mean it, of
course, but you are positively uncanny, and I could
not understand how——”</p>

<p>“It’s very simple, though,” Nick told him. “I’ve
been robbed of some papers, unfortunately, and those
dealing with your case are among them. Naturally,
therefore, when you rushed in in that fashion, I concluded
that the thief had tried to bleed you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! So that was it?” Gillespie murmured somewhat
sheepishly. Again his anger and sense of injury
got the upper hand. “Then it’s you I have to thank
for this, after all!” he cried. “I supposed my secret
safe with you, as safe as if it were buried with me.
Now, you calmly announce that it has been stolen
from you. This is too much, Carter! Can’t you keep
your papers where they will be safe? What right have
you got to preserve such records, anyway? Why don’t
you destroy them for the sake of your clients? It’s
unbearable! This will be the ruin of me! If Florence
finds out about it, she will refuse to marry me,
and——”</p>

<p>The detective held up his hand commandingly, and
the young man—he did not appear to be over twenty-five—lapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>“I have already told you, Gillespie, that I profoundly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
regret what has happened. You are forgetting
yourself, though, and wasting time. I already know
who made away with those papers, and, with your assistance,
I hope to lay a trap for him that will bring
his schemes to an end very quickly. I think I can promise
you that there will be no publicity, and that nothing
need interfere with your approaching marriage.
Now, tell me precisely what has happened.”</p>

<p>Young Gillespie was several times a millionaire,
having inherited a large fortune from his father a
year or two before. The responsibility thus imposed
upon him had sobered him down in a remarkable manner,
and he was looked upon in certain quarters as
one of the coming leaders in the financial world. Before
his father’s death, however, he had sown a lot
of wild oats of one sort or another, and it was in connection
with one of these youthful escapades that Nick
had been called in about four years previously.</p>

<p>The affair threatened to be very serious, for the
time, but the detective’s skill had been brought to bear
in a surprising manner, with the result that everything
had been smoothed out as well as possible without
the vaguest rumor having got abroad.</p>

<p>The young man fumbled in his pocket with a gloved
hand, and produced a sheet of notepaper, the top of
which had obviously been cut away.</p>

<p>“That was found under the door when the house
was opened up this morning,” he said. “Here’s the
envelope. It was not stamped, of course.”</p>

<p>Nick smoothed out the sheet of paper and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
at the sprawling, uncertain writing that covered it. He
read:</p>

<p>“I know all about the affair of four years ago. My
price for silence is one hundred thousand dollars.
Have it ready when I call, or pay it to any one who may
present an order from me. Don’t think you can stop
this by trying to have me arrested. You will fail, and
the whole story will come out. I have fully arranged
for its publication, no matter what happens to me.
The money is the only thing that will buy my silence.
Pay it, and your secret is safe. What is more, you
will never hear from me again. Refuse to pay it,
and—ruin!”</p>

<p>It was a bold letter, but Nick saw that it was nothing
but a bluff. He said as much.</p>

<p>“I hope you haven’t been deceived by this,” he
remarked, tapping the sheet. “This fellow is working
alone, you may be sure, and, therefore, it isn’t at all
likely that he has ‘arranged’ anything of the sort in
case he should be arrested. By this, as you ought to
know, the newspapers would not publish a story about
you without warning. You have too much money and
too many friends. You would have an opportunity to
bring your influence to bear, and the story would be
killed.”</p>

<p>“That sounds plausible enough,” Gillespie admitted.
“That’s what I would tell any one else in my position,
if he were similarly threatened. When this sort of
thing comes home to a fellow, though, it makes a lot
of difference.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know,” the detective replied, with a nod. “That’s
the sort of mood such a scoundrel counts on.”</p>

<p>He paused and thoughtfully fingered the letter.</p>

<p>“I must confess that this is a disappointment,” he
resumed slowly. “I had hoped that the blackmailer
would set a definite time for his call, or ask you to
take the money to some specified place. This, however,
avoids anything of that sort, and leaves me nothing
definite to go on. All it tells us is that he expects to
call at some unnamed hour—perhaps to-day, perhaps
to-morrow, perhaps not for several days. I think we
need not bother about the hint that he may send some
one with a written order, for if such a person presented
himself, I feel sure it would be the blackmailer,
and no other. This absence of details, however,
makes it rather difficult to know just what to do.”</p>

<p>“How would this do?” Gillespie said hesitatingly.
“You are a genius at make-up. Why don’t you pass
yourself off for me? Go to my place on Fifth Avenue
and wait for this fellow, whoever he is, to call? The
chances are that he won’t put it off very long, and
even if you had to remain there a couple of days, you
would not mind, would you, if you could nab your
man at the end of your wait?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.
<br />
<small>AN ASTOUNDING RUSE.</small></h2>


<p>Gillespie went on more confidently: “It ought to
give him the shock of his life to think he’s dealing
merely with me, and then to have you reveal yourself
to him. Of course, we could both stay there, and you
could walk in and collar him while he was holding
me up, but I’m afraid he may be watching the house.
In that case, he would be suspicious if he saw any one
else going in and not coming out again, no matter
whether he recognized you or not.”</p>

<p>Nick smiled slightly. “You must have been reading
detective stories lately, Gillespie,” he commented.
“However, it isn’t a bad idea, and I’m inclined to try
it. There are certain other advantages about it which
make it appeal to me. How about you, though? You
would have to remain here as long as I found it necessary
to stay at your place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I don’t mind. I’ll promise
to keep out of sight, and if I have to stay overnight, I
suppose I can find a bunk somewhere, if you’ll explain
my presence to your servants.”</p>

<p>“You certainly can,” Nick assured him; “and let’s
hope that you won’t have to kick your heels here very
long.”</p>

<p>The detective conducted him into another room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and, seating him in the light, proceeded to busy himself
with his make-up materials and appliances. At
the end of half an hour, the transformation was complete.</p>

<p>“Will this do?” asked Nick, turning from the glass
and facing his visitor.</p>

<p>“By Jove, marvelous!” Gillespie cried enthusiastically.
“By the time you’ve got into my clothes, you’ll
be able to pass for me anywhere. Luckily, there’s only
my old butler, Simms, and his wife, at the house, as
I’ve been abroad, and was not expected home as yet.
The chauffeur outside is a new man, and has never
seen me before.”</p>

<p>“Good!” Nick answered. “Now for the clothes.”</p>

<p>Soon the disguise was complete, and after another
careful inspection of himself, Nick was ready to leave.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain matters to my people here as I go out,”
he said. “Come this way and I’ll show you the room
you may occupy in my absence. I hope you’ll find it
comfortable. Don’t hesitate to ask for anything you
want, and I’ll let you know as soon as there’s anything
to report.”</p>

<p>After conducting his guest to one of the spare bedrooms,
the detective parted with Gillespie, and ascended
the stairs. Five minutes later he stepped into
the waiting car as if he owned it.</p>

<p>“Home!” he ordered, and the machine whirled away
in the direction of upper Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from behind one of the curtains at the
front of the detective’s house, the young man had seen
the car drive off, and as it passed out of sight, a remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
change came over him. He threw back his
head and laughed in a curiously noiseless way that
many an ex-convict has.</p>

<p>He laughed until the tears rolled down his cheeks,
and at last flung himself into a chair and fairly panted
for breath. At length, he recovered himself and wiped
his eyes. Simultaneously, his face took on harsher
lines.</p>

<p>The fresh complexion of youth seemed singularly
out of place now, for age and experience—and evil—peered
through the veneer.</p>

<p>Had there ever been any doubt about Green-eye
Gordon’s daring, there could be none any longer, for
this was the criminal himself.</p>

<p>In some manner best known to himself, he had
managed to learn of Nick’s return, and had taken this
extraordinary means of fooling the detective—an example
of supreme audacity, in which he was manifestly
taking the greatest delight.</p>

<p>He expected to kill more than two birds with the
one stone.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a sell!” he thought. “How are the mighty
fallen! You don’t happen to know, my dear Carter,
that the real Chester Gillespie is still abroad, and that
while you are waiting for your bird in that gloomy
old mansion across from the park, your enterprising
little friend Ernest will be tapping the various other
sources of income as rapidly as he can.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the first flush of triumph had
passed, there seemed to be an undercurrent of uneasiness
in the scoundrel’s mood and manner. Doubtless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
he knew that in boldness lay his only hope, but perhaps
he allowed himself to fear for the time being,
that even boldness would be insufficient in the long run
against such an antagonist.</p>

<p>Apparently, the great detective had been completely
taken in by this latest astounding ruse, but very likely
Gordon realized that he was in the lion’s mouth, and
that there was no knowing when the jaws might close
with a snap.</p>

<p>Some time after Green Eye returned to Nick’s study,
the door opened, and Chick entered. He did not look
any too well satisfied with his work thus far.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said, halting at sight of
the supposed Gillespie. “I didn’t know any one was
here. Are you alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Gordon answered coolly. “Mr. Carter has
gone out. I think he left word for you with the butler,
but I might as well explain that he’s absent on an
errand for me, and that I’m to remain in more or less
close confinement here until he returns.”</p>

<p>And in response to a look of surprise on Chick’s
face, he explained a little further: “If you wish to
call him up——”</p>

<p>“No, not now,” Nick’s assistant interrupted quietly.
“I have nothing to report as yet.”</p>

<p>That was good news to Gordon, for he felt sure
that Chick had been trying to pick up some clew to
the whereabouts of the electric car, and if so, it was
plain that he had failed to make any headway.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll leave you in possession here and go into
the room Mr. Carter placed at my command,” Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Eye remarked easily, rising to his feet and helping
himself to another of Nick’s cigars. “If there’s no
objection, I shall appropriate some writing materials.”</p>

<p>Chick supplied him with paper, envelopes, et cetera,
and assured him that the study was his to use if he
wished, but the visitor would not consent to “be in the
way.” Three minutes later, he was in the bedroom,
with the door closed.</p>

<p>Quickly he removed the tapestry cover and droplight
from the small table between the windows, and,
drawing up a chair, set to work.</p>

<p>It was clear that his desire to write some letters
was genuine enough, and the fact that he cut the engraved
headings from several sheets of paper suggested
that the privacy of the room was welcome.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour he was still writing, and beside
him were several sealed and stamped envelopes
addressed to a number of well-known names. The
campaign was going forward.</p>

<p>“I shall have to find some means of getting rid of
this man Chick Carter, though,” Green Eye told himself,
as he finished one of the letters and leaned back
in a chair. “These fellows I have written to will come
flocking here before long, and I must be Nick Carter
again, in order to receive them properly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.
<br />
<small>NICK’S SUSPICIONS CONFIRMED.</small></h2>


<p>If the criminal could have read Nick Carter’s mind
about that time, he would have been still more uneasy—and
with good reason.</p>

<p>Ernest Gordon had not been the only one who had
played a part during the interview which had ended
in the detective’s act of copying his caller’s features,
and borrowing his clothes.</p>

<p>For the first few minutes, it must be confessed that
the detective was completely deceived. He knew Green
Eye to be a master of surprises, but it had not occurred
to him to suspect that the clever rascal would
resort to anything so spectacular.</p>

<p>Besides, Gordon had placed himself so that the light
did not fall strongly.</p>

<p>It was not until the caller suggested a change of
identities that the detective began to question. It was
very seldom that a client presumed to offer such assistance,
and Nick’s knowledge of Chester Gillespie
had not prepared him for such a proposition. He gave
no evidence, however, that the seed of suspicion had
been planted, but fell in with the suggestion, knowing
that in carrying it out, he would have the best possible
opportunity of studying his visitor.</p>

<p>He noted a slight hesitation on the latter’s part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
when he had asked him to take his place in the brightest
light obtainable, and the subsequent scrutiny had
soon confirmed his suspicions. “Gillespie” was plainly
Ernest Gordon.</p>

<p>No make-up could have stood that test—at least,
with Nick Carter at the observer’s end.</p>

<p>“What fools the cleverest of us are sometimes!”
the detective thought, with an inward chuckle. “Gordon
has such a good opinion of himself, and is so
certain that a man needs only to be daring enough
in order to carry everything before him, that he’s actually
willing to undergo this sort of thing—and he
thinks he’s getting away with it!”</p>

<p>It was no part of the detective’s plan, however, to
reveal his knowledge of the deception. He wished to
give the masquerader as much rope as he could, in
order to find out just what Gordon was trying to do.
Moreover, he was curious to visit Gillespie’s house and
find out how Green Eye had succeeded in making himself
at home there.</p>

<p>Gillespie might have been overpowered and stowed
away somewhere, or even murdered—though that was
unlikely, unless the crime had been committed owing
to an accident or miscalculation on Gordon’s part.</p>

<p>When the detective reached Gillespie’s house on
Fifth Avenue, he found the situation just as Gordon
had described it. An aged butler answered the bell,
and, save for him, the big house seemed deserted.</p>

<p>Nick was about to question the old man in a roundabout
way in order to discover, if possible, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
there had been anything which might seem suspicious
or not. Before he could do so, however, the butler offered
a couple of letters on a salver.</p>

<p>Nick took them after a second’s hesitation, studying
the butler’s face as he did so. From the man’s
squint and the lines about the eyes, he saw that the
butler was nearsighted. Probably he had been in the
family for a long time, but this defect in his eyesight
explained his failure to detect the deception.</p>

<p>But where was the real Chester J. Gillespie, whose
second double was now entering his house, and calmly
inspecting his letters?</p>

<p>Gordon had given Nick certain necessary particulars
concerning the arrangement of the house, and,
thanks to these, the detective mounted the stairs with
the utmost assurance, leaving the nearsighted old butler
bowing in the lower hall.</p>

<p>He found his way to Gillespie’s private room easily
enough, the letters still in his hand. After looking
about him curiously, and noting the certain evidences
of recent occupancy, he sat down and glanced mechanically
at the letters.</p>

<p>One of them obviously was a business communication,
but the other was not.</p>

<p>The envelope was unusually large, and of the finest
texture. As for the writing, it was big, heavy, and
sprawling.</p>

<p>In the lower left-hand corner were the words, “Important—please
forward,” and they were heavily underscored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>All is fair in love and war, they say, and if that
is so, all is fair in detection as well, especially when
the detective is trying to safeguard the man whose
identity he has temporarily appropriated.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, therefore, Nick felt justified
in opening any of Gillespie’s correspondence that
seemed to promise a solution of the mystery, just as
he would have ransacked the house for a similar clew.</p>

<p>There might be nothing in it, of course, but this
letter appeared to be somewhat out of the ordinary,
and might be valuable.</p>

<p>Consequently, after a little hesitation, Nick ripped
the envelope open without the slightest attempt at
concealment, and drew the inclosure out. Soon he
was very glad that he had done so, for the letter read
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Old Lunatic</span>: You do not seem to have
improved in the matter of memory or level-headedness.
You write me from some unpronounceable place
in South America—I judge solely from the postmark—and
do not tell me where to find you. How the dickens
can I join you down there for a month’s shooting,
if you do not give me more particulars? I know you
too well, you see, to imagine for a moment that you
stayed more than a day or two at the place from which
you wrote. That was nearly two weeks ago, and by
this time you may be thousands of miles away from
there.</p>

<p>“Your letter was forwarded to me up here in Maine,
and the best thing I can think of doing is to send this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to your New York address, in the hope that it will
be forwarded to you with as little delay as possible.”</p>
</div>

<p>There was a little more of it, but the rest does not
matter. It was signed by a well-known young man
about town.</p>

<p>So that was it, was it? The only original Chester
Gillespie was still down in South America, and only
about two weeks before had written to a New York
friend, inviting him down for a month’s shooting.
That argued that he did not expect to return for many
weeks. In some manner, Gordon must have learned
that interesting fact, and, seemingly, had disguised
himself as Gillespie, with the aid of a photograph or
photographs of that young man.</p>

<p>So much for the way the trick had been sprung.
For the rest, there was no doubt in Nick’s mind as to
Green Eye’s further intention. The criminal had
learned of the detective’s return, and had guessed what
Nick’s plan of campaign would be.</p>

<p>In other words, he had concluded that Nick had
the index of the records in the safe, and could easily
find out which ones were missing. Knowing by that
means where danger threatened, Nick could set a trap
for the blackmailer, with the help of one or more of
the latter’s prospective victims.</p>

<p>“He knew just about what to expect,” the detective
mused, “and when he found that Gillespie was out of
the country, having left only a couple of old people
in charge of the house, he hit upon this scheme of circumventing
me. If he’s left alone, he’ll find some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
means of sending Chick off on a wild-goose chase, or
otherwise dispose of him, and then he’ll impersonate
me once more, and in that disguise he’ll probably advise
his victims to pay the sums demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a pretty smooth scheme—one of the
smoothest anybody ever thought out! I’m afraid, however,
that he’s inclined to underrate my intelligence,
and to overrate his own ability.”</p>

<small>COMPARING NOTES.</small></h2>


<p>It was not until dusk that Nick Carter left the Gillespie
house, and when he did so, it was on foot. He
had not gone more than a block or so, however, before
he hailed a passing taxi, and ordered the chauffeur
to drive to a certain corner of Madison Avenue.
The corner named was only a block from his own
house.</p>

<p>Some hours had passed since Nick had read the letter
which revealed the whereabouts of the real Chester
J. Gillespie, but he had been in no hurry to act. For
one thing, he wished to give the scoundrel a sense of
security in this new and climax-capping adventure.</p>

<p>Nick was still disguised as Gillespie, but he was
wearing a golf cap, which he had pulled down over
his eyes, and a light overcoat, with upturned collar.
His purpose was to get in touch with his assistant in
one way or another, and his only anxiety concerned
the possibility that Gordon had already got rid of
Chick.</p>

<p>Fortunately, that was not the case, and, after a wait
of no more than half or three-quarters of an hour,
the young detective left the house, and unconsciously
approached his chief, who was lounging at the corner.</p>

<p>As he passed Nick, the latter said quietly: “Go
around the corner and wait for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Chick stiffened slightly at the well-known voice,
but that was the only sign of surprise he gave. With a
grunt and a nod, he turned about at right angles into
the side street, and along this Nick presently followed
him.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond the corner, well out of sight
from Nick’s house, Chick paused, and there his chief
overtook him.</p>

<p>“I haven’t made any headway yet,” Chick announced,
without any preliminaries. “I located the
car late this afternoon, but there I came to a dead
stop.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that,” Nick said quickly. “It
doesn’t matter in the least. I can lay my hands on
Green-eye Gordon at any moment.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you can!” ejaculated Chick. “Then I
should certainly say you don’t need me—for the sort
of legwork I’ve been doing to-day, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“What about my double, though?” Nick put in
swiftly, without giving Chick time to ask any questions.
“Is he still at the house, and if so, what has he
been doing?”</p>

<p>“He’s there, all right. He’s been writing letters
in the bedroom. He declined to use the study.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Nick murmured, in a peculiar tone. “Letters,
eh? Has he mailed them?”</p>

<p>“No. I offered to do it for him a little while ago,
but he said he would be going out himself later on.”</p>

<p>Nick thought over this information for a minute or
two, while his assistant watched him questioningly.</p>

<p>“Did you happen to see any of the letters?” Nick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
inquired at length, rousing himself from his abstraction.
“I mean, could you tell whether they were
stamped or not?”</p>

<p>His assistant nodded. “I got a squint at a little
pile of them,” he admitted. “The top one was
stamped, but I could not say as to the rest.”</p>

<p>This required further thought on Nick’s part. He
was tempted, of course, to end matters then and there,
before those letters could reach their destination, and
cause the consternation they were certain to create.
On the other hand, he felt it necessary to give Gordon
a little more leeway, and in order to do that, it seemed
essential that the letters be mailed.</p>

<p>He had searched Gillespie’s private rooms, on the
theory that Green Eye might have left the stolen papers
there, but he had found nothing of the sort. Yet,
it was imperative that these papers be recovered, if
possible, at the same time the rascal was captured.</p>

<p>Unless that were done, the precious records might
not be returned at all, for certainly Gordon could not
be counted on to restore them voluntarily.</p>

<p>To be sure, the fact that he had been writing those
letters—doubtless, blackmailing ones—under Nick’s
own roof, suggested that he had the documents there to
refer to. That, however, was by no means certain, for
he might have put the records in some remote place,
perhaps a safe-deposit vault, after making a list of
the names and addresses desired.</p>

<p>Therefore, it seemed wise to give the fellow his
head, for the time, and meanwhile to keep him under
observation, in the hope that his movements would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
give some hint as to his possession or nonpossession
of Nick’s papers.</p>

<p>The detective was about to explain this to his assistant
when the latter broke in excitedly.</p>

<p>“For the love of Pete! What’s up?” he demanded.
“What are you cooking up in that brain of yours, and
why are you so curious about Gillespie’s doings?”</p>

<p>“Gillespie is down in South America,” Nick returned
quietly. “That’s why. Our friend back there
in the house is—well, you can guess, I imagine.”</p>

<p>And then he proceeded to give his instructions to
the dumfounded Chick.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.
<br />
<small>GORDON’S LETTERS REACH THEIR MARK.</small></h2>


<p>Ex-Senator William Deane Phelps smiled complacently
as he stood before a glass in his dressing
room.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, and the sixty years that had
passed over his head had left him his rather slim and
upright figure. His hair was white, but abundant, and
on the whole, he had good reason to consider himself
a handsome and well-preserved man.</p>

<p>“Is there anything else, sir?” his valet asked respectfully.</p>

<p>“No,” the ex-senator answered. “It’s probable that
I shall be very late, so you need not wait up.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. Shall I ring for your car?”</p>

<p>“No, no! A taxi will do.”</p>

<p>Possibly the ghost of a smile curved the lips of the
valet, but if so, it was quickly gone. If his employer
chose to keep his movements secret, that was his employer’s
business.</p>

<p>Ex-Senator Phelps took the light coat and silk hat
that were handed to him, and strolled toward the door.
He was a single man, but his position in the world had
made it necessary for him to keep up a rather pretentious
establishment.</p>

<p>He stood in the doorway holding a cigar as the taxi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
drove up, but at that moment his valet, who had followed
him as if to close the door, spoke up in a surprised
tone.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” he said, “but this was lying
on the floor. You stepped over it just now without
knowing it. It’s addressed to you, and marked ‘Urgent.’
It’s stamped, but not postmarked—looks as
if it had been slipped under the door instead.”</p>

<p>Ex-Senator Phelps took the envelope with a careless
air, and no premonition chilled him as he stepped
back into the light of the hall and tore it open. As he
glanced at the single sheet of paper, however, his face
turned ghastly, and he reeled against a small statue
that stood on a pedestal, throwing it to the floor and
breaking it.</p>

<p>“After all these years!” he muttered hoarsely to
himself. Then his eyes fell upon the amazed face of
his valet, and, as he crushed the letter in his hand, he
made a great effort to pull himself together. “I—I
shall not be going out, after all,” he said, in a curiously
dead voice. “I’m not—feeling well.”</p>

<p>Every year of the sixty seemed to weigh heavily
upon the ex-senator as he pushed open the door of the
room on the left. His feet dragged across the thick
carpet so that he stumbled, and when he dropped into
a chair, buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p class="asterism">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The Forty-second Street Theater had been famous
for years as the home of light comedy of the more brilliant
sort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>That night was to witness a new production, for
which great things were expected—for had the play
not been written by one of America’s cleverest and
most experienced playwrights, and staged by a production
wizard? And was not the star Harold Lumsden?</p>

<p>Already the cheaper parts of the house were packed,
and the orchestra was filling up. Here and there a pair
of white shoulders gleamed in one of the boxes which
would soon be filled—for it was a foregone conclusion
that the S.R.O. sign would have to be displayed in
the lobby that night.</p>

<p>Harold Lumsden himself was peering through a
peephole in the curtain at that moment, idly surveying
the nucleus of what he knew would prove to be an unusually
brilliant first-night audience. For years he had
enjoyed great prestige, and this was to be his first appearance
following a successful invasion of London,
which had added greatly to his laurels.</p>

<p>“This is going to be some night, Harold!” his manager
remarked impressively, coming up from behind
and putting his hand on the star’s shoulder. “Dressed
early, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I felt restless,” was the reply. “Hanged if I
know why. This sort of thing ought to be an old story
to me by this time, if it’s ever going to be.”</p>

<p>As he turned about to face the portly manager, he
noticed an envelope in the latter’s hand. Knowing the
manager’s absent-mindedness, he inquired:</p>

<p>“That letter isn’t for me, is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, yes, it is,” was the reply. “I had forgotten
it for a moment. It’s marked ‘Urgent,’ but I suppose
it’s only from some friend of yours—or, more
likely, some friend of a friend—who aspires to the
deadhead class.”</p>

<p>“Probably,” Harold Lumsden agreed, as he glanced
at the handwriting for a moment, and then ripped the
envelope open. “We haven’t needed to ‘paper’ our
houses for the last few seasons, have we, old man?
What’s this! Great heavens!”</p>

<p>The distinguished actor clutched at one of the wings
for support, and the letter fluttered to the ground.
The manager stooped to pick it up, but with an oath
the star forestalled him, seizing the letter hastily and
thrusting it into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Bad news?” the manager asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“A rather disagreeable surprise,” Lumsden managed
to say, making a strenuous attempt to control
himself. “It’s nothing you know anything about, you
know, and I’ll be all right, never fear.”</p>

<p>Harold Lumsden played the part that night, for
there was nothing else to do, and the traditions of his
profession demand that an actor or actress should always
appear, unless ill in bed, no matter what news
may have been received, or what tragedy may have
been left at home.</p>

<p>But some idea of the sort of performance the famous
star gave on that memorable occasion might have
been gathered from the newspaper comments the following
morning, for all the critics seemed to agree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
that Lumsden was far from himself, and that his conception
of the part was strangely heavy and lifeless.</p>

<p>Such was the effect of Green-eye Gordon’s second
demand. There were other letters—several of them,
in fact—but we need not trace their influence here.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the blackmailer had struck
some stunning blows, expecting that gold would flow
from the wounds thus inflicted.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.
<br />
<small>THE BLACKMAILER ADVISES HIS VICTIM.</small></h2>


<p>Ernest Gordon was inclined to consider the world
a pretty good place, as he finished his breakfast in
Nick Carter’s dining room the following morning.
Everything had gone very well, thus far, and he
seemed to have reason for self-congratulation.</p>

<p>He had peddled the letters around himself the night
before, thus saving time, and making it more difficult
to trace them, as he believed. He did not know that
he had been shadowed throughout by Chick, who
thereby knew just what victims the blackmailer had
chosen for his first broadside.</p>

<p>Later he had returned to the detective’s house, and
so had Chick; then there had come a telephone message
to the latter from Nick sending the young detective
out of town for at least twenty-four, if not forty-eight,
hours.</p>

<p>That unexpected turn of affairs had caused Gordon
great satisfaction when Chick gloomily confided the
news to him.</p>

<p>“The chief seems to think that fellow Gordon has
doubled back, and is hiding not far from New Pelham,”
the assistant informed “Gillespie.” “He still
hopes he’ll turn up at your place, and is going to wait
there all of to-morrow, if not longer, but he wants me
to get busy, and see if I can locate Gordon independently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
It seems unnecessary to me, but what he says
goes. The worst of it is, though, I’ve got my orders
to pull up stakes at once.”</p>

<p>Of course, Gordon did not know that this was all
a put-up job. Nick, by seeming to play into the rascal’s
hands, had worked out this scheme, in order to get
Chick out of the way, so that Gordon would not feel
compelled to take strong measures to accomplish the
same object.</p>

<p>As a result, Green Eye had slept alone at Nick’s
house that night—except for the servants—and now,
after a good breakfast, looked forward to a day of
undisturbed peace and freedom to do whatever circumstances
might require.</p>

<p>First, however, it was necessary for him to absent
himself temporarily, in order to make up as Nick once
more. Therefore, he made a flying trip to One Hundred
and Twenty-fifth Street, and there disguised himself,
returning as fast as the taxi could carry him.</p>

<p>When he reëntered the detective’s residence, it was
in the character of the owner.</p>

<p>“Has any one called up or been to see me?” he asked
the butler.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” was the reply, a welcome one to the
scoundrel, for it meant that none of his victims had
yet sought the detective.</p>

<p>He did not have long to wait, however, for hardly
more than half an hour later the butler entered the
study, and presented a card, which bore the name of
ex-Senator William Deane Phelps.</p>

<p>“Show him up,” the supposed detective said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>The butler turned on his heel to obey, and if Green-eye
Gordon grinned behind his back, his face was
serious enough in expression as the ex-senator nervously
entered and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>In the few hours that had passed since he had received
the threatening letter, a great change had come
over this man, whose name was known from one end
of the country to the other. It was plain that he had
not slept, and there were heavy, loose bags of skin under
his eyes. His face was almost gray in hue.</p>

<p>“I feared that you would feel compelled to come
here before long, senator,” the impostor said gravely.</p>

<p>“Then you know?” his visitor asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Gordon answered. “Some one knows the
facts in regard to—well, we need not go into the case—and
is attempting to blackmail you.”</p>

<p>Phelps sank into a chair and drew a sheet of paper
from his pocket.</p>

<p>“The infernal scoundrel demands one hundred and
fifty thousand—no less!” he said hoarsely. “It isn’t so
much the money, but I—I naturally assumed that you
alone held my secret.”</p>

<p>Green Eye rose to his feet, and his face was very
solemn.</p>

<p>“Until a short time ago that was the case,” he answered,
and crossed to the safe. “The records were
here, and you will see that it has been burgled. If it’s
any comfort to you, though, I’ll tell you that you are
not the only one who will suffer.”</p>

<p>“I care nothing about that,” Phelps said angrily.
“It’s my own plight that interests me to the exclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of everything else. Do you wonder? This is terrible,
Carter, terrible! I thought I could trust you, and now,
after all this time, I find that I’ve been living in a
fool’s paradise.”</p>

<p>The criminal interrupted him with a dignified gesture.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I deserve that, senator,” he said quietly.
“Nicholas Carter has never yet betrayed a secret.
Much as I regret this unfortunate occurrence, however,
I don’t see how I can be held responsible for it.
I didn’t rob my own safe, and certainly I wouldn’t
have chosen to have it robbed, if I could have helped
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s neither here nor there!” declared the ex-senator.
“Why didn’t you destroy the records?”</p>

<p>“Do you expect me to destroy my stock in trade, or
burn up the reference books I have had occasion to
consult countless times?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of it in that light,” Phelps confessed.
“Even that doesn’t make it any easier to bear,
however. What can I do?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say that I see nothing for you to do,
except to pay,” Green Eye answered, fingering the
letter which had been handed him.</p>

<p>Phelps looked at him in amazement. “<em>You</em> actually
give me that advice!” he murmured.</p>

<p>Green Eye nodded. “I know I’m disappointing you,”
he said, “but that’s the best advice I can give under
the circumstances. It may sound strange, but we must
face the facts. I know perfectly well who is at the
bottom of this, and I have to confess that he’s one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the shrewdest men who ever defied the law. He’s
amazingly daring, senator, and you may be sure he
means exactly what he says. He’ll drag this whole
unsavory business into the light, if you don’t stop his
mouth with gold, and stop it without delay.”</p>

<p>“But aren’t you going to——”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m going to do everything I can to
catch him, senator,” the criminal interrupted, in a
tone which seemed to imply that that was a matter of
course. “If possible, I shall try to trap him just after
you have met his demands, and while he has the money
on his person. I cannot promise, however, to catch
him to-day, or this week, and, knowing his methods
as well as I do, I know that you can’t afford to risk
any delay. The chances are, of course, that I can
make him disgorge, and that you’ll get your money
back, but the important thing is to play safe, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Ex-Senator Phelps nodded slowly and hopelessly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re right,” he agreed. “I had hoped
for immediate help, Carter, for something that would
put new hope into me. Evidently, I expected too much,
though. I’ll do as you say, of course, and try to
believe that everything will come out all right. Good
morning.”</p>

<p>And with that he left the room, walking as if he
were seventy instead of sixty.</p>

<p>“Number one!” Green-eye Gordon chuckled as he
leaned back in his seat. “A hundred and fifty thousand
isn’t bad for a starter. I wonder who will be
the next?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.
<br />
<small>UP AGAINST IT.</small></h2>


<p>A few minutes later, the front-door bell rang again,
and this time the salver which the butler presented to
his supposed employer bore the card of Harold Lumsden.</p>

<p>Gordon nodded impassively. “Very well,” he said.</p>

<p>“I only hope he’ll prove worth the trouble,” he told
himself, as the butler left the room. “He’s a spendthrift,
of course. Money turns to water and runs
through his fingers, no matter how fast it comes in.
He’s just back from London, however, and I hardly
think he has already squandered everything he picked
up there.”</p>

<p>Then the door opened, and a tragic figure entered.
The caller’s face was haggard, his eyes wild, his hair
disordered. Even his clothing seemed carelessly worn
and ill-fitting, though Lumsden had always been considered
one of the best-dressed men in the profession.
Certainly he did not look like a matinee idol now.</p>

<p>“Something terrible has happened!” he burst out.
“Mr. Carter, I am being blackmailed! Somebody has
learned the secret which I thought safe with you, and
has demanded an enormous sum of money. It means
my ruin, unless——”</p>

<p>“I know all about it, I am sorry to say,” the bogus
detective interrupted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more he gave a brief and very unsatisfactory
explanation, pointing to the rifled safe, and winding
up with a statement of his belief that there was nothing
to do but to pay—“just as a temporary expedient,
of course.”</p>

<p>Naturally, that advice did not appeal to the actor
any more than it had to ex-Senator Phelps, but Gordon
adroitly argued him into a somewhat less impatient
mood.</p>

<p>“How much does he want?”</p>

<p>“A cool hundred thousand,” was the bitter reply,
and it did not convey any real news to the man in
Nick’s desk chair. “And I haven’t more than eighty
thousand to my name!”</p>

<p>“The devil you haven’t!” Green Eye exclaimed
harshly. “Not after that London engagement?”</p>

<p>He had spoken without thinking, and did not realize
what he had said until the caller looked sharply at him.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Lumsden!” he hastened to say.
“That must have sounded impertinent, I’m afraid. I
meant no offense, I assure you. It was merely surprise.
You know, we outsiders are inclined to think
that you popular actors are made of money.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re not,” the other answered, as if slightly
mollified. “What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Pay what you can,” Gordon answered promptly.
“I know it doesn’t appeal to you, my friend, but as I
have said, it’s only temporary. I’ll have the fellow
where I want him in short order, you may be sure.
This is only in the nature of insurance to keep the rascal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
from carrying out his threats before I can stop
his activities.”</p>

<p>That seemed to appeal strongly to the actor.</p>

<p>“It’s asking a good deal to trust everything to you,
including my whole bank roll, when the trouble originated
through you,” he said. “However, I see nothing
else to do. I’ll do as you suggest. Anything is
better than exposure, and I can always earn more
money if I have to see the last of this.” He paused for
a moment. “By Jove!” he ejaculated. “You have
made me feel that I shan’t be comfortable until I’ve
paid the money over. If you don’t mind, I’ll make
out a check to self right now, and take it to the bank
to be cashed, so that I can turn over the currency to
the scoundrel when he comes.”</p>

<p>Green Eye had no objection to that, of course; in
fact, it brought an anticipatory glitter to his eyes.
With shaking hands, Lumsden took a check book
from his pocket, seating himself in the chair which
Gordon vacated for the purpose. When he tried to
write, however, he found it exceedingly difficult to
do so.</p>

<p>“Confound it!” he cried impatiently. “See how infernally
nervous I am! Would you mind filling this
in for eighty thousand, Mr. Carter, and then I’ll try
to sign it.”</p>

<p>“Gladly,” Green Eye said, with alacrity, reseating
himself in the vacated chair, and taking the pen from
his visitor’s trembling hand.</p>

<p>The masquerading criminal held down the cover of
the little check book with his left hand, while he began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to write with the other. Lumsden leaned over his
shoulder, watching him, as if ready to try his luck at
signing his name as soon as the rest of the check was
filled in. His hand slipped into his pocket, however,
and when it came out silently, there was something in
it which had a metallic gleam.</p>

<p>“Ah! Thanks!” he exclaimed, a moment or two
later. “You have made it very easy for me, Gordon!”</p>

<p>Simultaneously there was a sudden, unlooked-for
swoop, followed quickly by the click of a pair of handcuffs
as they closed on Green Eye’s wrists.</p>

<p>And the voice which uttered the mocking words
was not the voice of Harold Lumsden, but that of Nick
Carter himself. Gordon knew it after the first word
or two, and even if he had not done so, the action
which went along with it would have been enlightening
enough.</p>

<p>“Nick Carter, by Heaven!” the rogue cried hoarsely,
jumping to his feet and overturning the chair.</p>

<p>“Nick Carter—exactly,” the detective agreed, removing
the wig which had played such a large part
in transforming him into Harold Lumsden. “You
didn’t think you were going to have this little masked
ball all to yourself, did you?”</p>

<p>After the first dazed shock—a merely momentary
one—had passed, Gordon’s face seemed to grow actually
black with rage and hatred.</p>

<p>“You may think you have me, curse you!” he
snarled. “But I’ll show you——”</p>

<p>He leaped forward, his manacled arms raised to
strike together. Nick quietly sidestepped the mad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
bull-like rush, but Green Eye turned and charged him
again.</p>

<p>There was one more surprise awaiting him, though.
The door opened, and Chick entered, coolly fingering
an automatic.</p>

<p>“Pretty neat weapon, isn’t it, Gordon?” he asked,
in a matter-of-fact tone, then stopped in feigned surprise.
“Oh, you and the chief are having an argument?
Hope you don’t think I’ve butted in. Now
that I’m here, though, I think I might as well stay.
You look as if you needed your wrists slapped, and
the chief may not care to bother with it.”</p>

<p>The escaped convict had halted in his tracks at the
first interruption, and was now looking from the detective
to his assistant with baffled rage. He would have
liked to fight it out to a finish, but his shrewdness told
him that he would gain nothing by such a course, and
it was one of his rules never to exert himself unnecessarily.
The consequence was that he merely shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“So be it,” he said quietly. “You fellows can trump
my ace, I see. Let me remind you, however, that you
haven’t got that gold that our mutual friend, John
Simpson, took such a liking to. Likewise, you’re a
long way from the possession of those papers which
you were foolish enough to keep in a more or less
ordinary safe.”</p>

<p>The detectives looked at each other and grinned.</p>

<p>“Think so?” queried Nick. “I’m afraid, in that case,
that you are scheduled to receive another disagreeable
surprise or two. I located the gold yesterday afternoon—in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
one of Gillespie’s closets. As for the missing
records, I feel very sure that we shall discover
them on you.”</p>

<p>And they did.</p>

<p>Therefore, there was no need of delay, and No.
39,470 Clinton was shipped northward to Dannemora
the next day, under escort.</p>

<p>“Lucky for us that he belonged to the ‘Gray Brotherhood,’”
Nick remarked to Griswold, when he
turned a little over seventy-five thousand dollars in
gold over to him. “Otherwise, he would have gone
scot-free, just as in the case of Simpson. As it is,
he’ll get something extra for his escape, at least, and
I don’t believe he’ll have a chance to slip away again.</p>

<p>“But another case like this would give me heart
disease, I’m afraid,” he added to himself.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge">The Chain of Clues</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold large p1">By NICHOLAS CARTER</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold p1">New Magnet Library No. 1030</p>


<p class="p2">A gamblers’ club with sixteen entrances
through sixteen different houses on three streets,
where gambling is prohibited, is certainly an interesting
background for a detective story.</p>

<p>Nick Carter becomes a member of such an organization
to trap a crook who held human life
so cheaply that his devilish crimes went unpunished
for a long time.</p>

<p>Nick matched his wits against those of the
criminal and won out—but how he did so will
hold your undivided interest.</p>

<p>If your dealer cannot supply this book immediately,
he will get it for you.</p>

<br />
Knows
<br />
Horatio Alger</p>


<p class="p2">But does everybody know that nearly all of his
celebrated books may be had in paper covers at
a most modest price?</p>

<p>It would seem so, from the orders for the Alger
books that are just rolling in.</p>

<p>If you want to give your boy friends a big
treat, ask any news dealer to sell you a few of
the Alger books he has in stock.</p>

<p>Big value in these days of high prices.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xlarge p2">A REQUEST</p>


<p class="p2">Conditions due to the war have made it very difficult
for us to keep in print all of the books listed in our
catalogues. We still have about fifteen hundred different
titles that we are in a position to supply. These
represent the best books in our line. We could not afford,
in the circumstances, to reprint any of the less
popular works.</p>

<p>We aim to keep in stock the works of such authors as
Bertha Clay, Charles Garvice, May Agnes Fleming,
Nicholas Carter, Mary J. Holmes, Mrs. Harriet Lewis,
Horatio Alger, and the other famous authors who are
represented in our line by ten or more titles. Therefore,
if your dealer cannot supply you with exactly the
book you want, you are almost sure to find in his stock
another title by the same author, which you have not
read.</p>

<p>In short, we are asking you to take what your dealer
can supply, rather than to insist upon just what you
want. You won’t lose anything by such substitution,
because the books by the authors named are very uniform
in quality.</p>

<p>In ordering Street &amp; Smith novels by mail, it is advisable
to make a choice of at least two titles for each
book wanted, so as to give us an opportunity to substitute
for titles that are now out of print.</p>
